binili ko to nung october tas dumating sa akin ngayong october yung packaging dapat po binububble wrap nyo po para secure lang sila sa isang lugar gumagana ba oo pero mabilis uminit yung cord pag magchacharge ka ng minutes iinit na agad yung core overall stars
all charging cables works just fine
ok nman yung item ngagamit n nmin ngayon sana lang mafragal kaya lang puro tatlong pink binigay myo eh ano b yun di n nasunod yung gusto ko n kulay kaya star lang bibigay ko
same issue as others violet at blue i received blue nag communicate naman ako to avoid this problem maiintindihan nman kung hindi available para hindi nkaka disappoint pagdating ng items pls do chat nman kung wala ung napili naming colors alagaan nyo ang buyers kse paulit ulit kaming oorder kung excellent ang seller we value the sellers asmuch as we hope you value us update without being told nagsend si seller ng pc vilolet cord very much appreciated thank you
ok naman kaso ilang araw lang na gamit bumabagal na ang pagcharge l 
my item just arrived wrong color ung isa light blue ung pinili ko na slightly mas mataas na presyo pero ung binigay sakin white yun ang gusto kong kulay kaya kahit hindi pareho ng presyo ng iba keri lang tas sila lang din pala ang masusunod kainis lang hindi ko pa na test pero tiwala naman ako na gumagana to pang reserba ko muna just incase hindi na gumana ung current cable ko 
pag dating ng package binayaran naman namen yung package and yung shipping fee pero bat walang laman wala yung item sa loob pa refund po 
sobra pala ang iksi nito less than meter haiissst mura lang kasi kung bakit kasi walang nakalagay sa description kung ano ang totoong length nito

kung ano nasa picture ganun nga siya tama lang sa presyo nya di lang tama yung kulay na pinadala wag na lang lagyan ng pagpilian ng kulay kung di rin naman pala susundin yung choice ng oorder atleast di kana magexpect pag random nakalagay dibaaa 
very useful
maganda naman un items kaso ang tagal ng delivery tapos hassle pa kulang un quantity tapos un courier gusto pick up in ko un items ko sa location niya eh delivery un request hnd naman pick up
complete orders pero hindi same ang colors sa pinili ko nung nagorder ako at pinakadisappointing yung black landyard dahil super nipis compared mo sa itsura sa reviews at mismong picture seller must improve
 days late seller not empathetic product is good but wrong color delivery is confusing 
kulang po dineliver sa akin dapat lang po ang nakalagay sa pouch paano yung kulang 
okay sana ung item kaso magkaiba ung kapal eh 
 days late seller not empathetic product is good but wrong color delivery is confusing 
do not buy this crap manipis sa actual this is a false advertisement
this is a complete disaster mali mali mga colors sobrang tagal pa ng delivery green order ginawa nyong yellow pink ginawa nyong violet paladesisyon kayo sa buhay ng ibang tao nakakafrustrate ang store nyo may guidelines pa kayo piliin ng maayos ang item kayo naman ang hindi nasunod 
i ordered pcs but i was only given pcs i messaged the seller about how can i get the other missing piece i also messaged the seller that i am about to order another set for my friend so maybe he can include the missing piece in my next order but the seller didnt reply 
hndi sya nakasama sa package nakalimutan yata ni seller 
very nice you can attach the spoon to its cover it is well sealed
got the items secured and fast at first i thought it was not paired with its parts because of disassembled parts to fit in the box but when you try to up side down the cover you will discover that it really fit to each other ganda though medyo maliit siya for me sana may pang half kilo or just at least ang laki nevertheless it serves its purpose
glass nga siya akala ko clear plastic lang maganda naman sya and medyo malaki kaya marami malalagay mabilis yung shipping thank you seller
excellent quality very accommodating seller well packaged item shipped immediately and will definitely order again
what u see is what u get 
 star lang sa akin si seller disappointed ako dahil yung isa sira ang pinadala niya hindi ko malaman kung nasunog ito sana yung mga ganitong itsura hindi niyo pinapadala sa buyer dahil binabayaran naman kayo ng tama kung kayo kaya bibili at ganito ang ibibigay sa inyo matutuwa ba kayo sana naisip niyo yun
nice and safe packaging nakarating dq lang nagustuhan ung naka post may rubber ung takip pero sa personal na product wala nmn pala kaya hindi xa nasara maayos ang takip di xa lapat na lapat singaw lng ang iba condiments na ilagay
maganda po sana ang productkulang lang ng handlesayangpakipadala po ung hawakan

i already used poco f from my friend and oppo a mine and still both devices wont detect from the adapter but kudos to the seller for the service that i got my refund and thank you so much i will wait for the stocks to be available i hope i get a working one
differnt item was delivered but i think the supplier give a extension or hdmi adapter
its working 
hindi kopa po nagagamit aantayin kopa yung usb dangle na type c sana hindi sira days refund namanbilis ng deliver days lang 
used at may not functioning now june but is good for additional monitor
its nice naresolve nya yung issue ka isa kong adaptor na mas mababa ang nabibigay nanresolution sa md monitor ko now parehas na sila ng resolution only problem pag tumagal nagfliflicker na ng husto at namamatay ang nd monitor na nakakabit ang adaptor kailangan tanggalin sa usb port at pagpahingahin
for a usb connection it delivers quite okay good for musicvideo playback and text reference but not really recommended for editing or for time sensitive references like music and video editingedited this unit doesnt support display rotation on macos catalina
its usable but i cant find where or what android comaptibility 
i think meron nga etong displaylink na chipset sinubukan kong iextend yung display ng samsung tablet ko sa external monitor at gumana nga siya download lang kayong app na displaylink presenter sa playstore at make sure na may otg support yung tablet now dapat din imake sure na yung android device niyo mismo ang magsisilbing usb host at hindi yung external display ang problema lang may times na hindi siya nagwowork kaagad at di ko madetermine kung ano yung problem hindi rin siya gumana sa nokia na phone ko maganda yung tech na to lalo na sa mga device na walang mhl na feature

super bilis ng delivery samin i love it then super light nya lang dalhin
the stand itself is made of a pretty cheap feeling plastic but its fully functional the fans feel weak but having fans is actually quite potent the stand only has height options by the way overall fully functional and worth it 
the product is amazing and functional and also the packaging was good and have fragile warning but theres a little bit delay 
di ganun kalakas fan pero ok nadin for its price magagamit ko din naman na stand para sa laptop ko
ok namn fan na sya pero not enough ung hangin nya malakas p ung fan nang laptop ko promise
sobrang hina ng fans walang ambag sa heat dissipation di man lang ma elevate yung tissue pls dont take it against the seller this review is for the product alone
sobrang hina do not buy sobrang hina do not buy sobrang hina do not buy sobrang hina do not buy 
not working kahit direct power at di sa laptop isaksak

i have this agreement with the seller that she did not do we agreed that she will ship with this product a replacement for the part i previously ordered i think she tricked me of buying another product so she may ship it with this product i ordered but turns out she did not do it 
working pero sobrang hina ng fan as in mahina
delivered in days pad works well and has bright light great deal 
 star for a very fast delivery it just took a day to deliver my order ayus din yung lights maraming siyang mode which makes it awesome but unfortunately hindi malakas yung kapit ng pandikit niya kaya i have to improvise using double sided tape but overall star for the item with regards sa quality and price
maayos ang packaging ni seller good buy ng mouse pad with rgb ndi q pa lang napapailaw kasi ndi pa nka set up laptopthank you seller
sobrang ganda pwede ibat ibang kulay kayo na bahala quality maraming pag pipilian pwede din iroll
very nice leds and lighting modes
may punit po yung pad cguro during handling ng courier natusok cguro kasi punit yung plastic at tagos sa box courier should handle the package well yupi yupi kasi yung box
napaka ayus naman ng patungan na ito at sobra ayus ang pag kakagawa nya at maganda ang ilaw nya madami at sakto sa lamesa ko
the lights are bright but there are some sections of rgb strip that light is dimmer but the price is worth it
very nice only issue is if plugged in laptop the light does not automatically close when you shut down the laptop you have to manually close it aside from that very good purchase 
i wish it had a breathing pattern making the color change more gradual and slower right now its pattern is too fast and too stiff reminds me of xmas lights that aside the pad itself is thick and feels premium
 units are working rgb lights are not working as intended will update to stars if a replacement or refund is issued
please help to replace the product time ko na purchase pero this time light sequence is not good mabagal compared dun sa st two na nabili ko ang hina ng bright light ng leds 
the texture is good but the light is not working when i plug it in it takes secs and then off
it wont change any color or even turn off when i tap the button or holdit only stays on green one color to be precisenot rgb
it wont change any color or even turn off when i tap the button or holdit only stays on green one color to be precisenot rgb
one color lang yung nag aappear i thought multicolor sya a bit disappointed kase hnd sya nagblend sa keyboard na binili ko hnd nagfufunction ung button para magiba ung kulay very sad

i am happy qnd satisfied with the vga cable that i purchased well packaged and it is totally working
nothing special just need a vga cable for my cctv system and the monitor they seem well made though 
just what i need two thumbs up

vga cable is working well they also shipped the correct size that i ordered update after using the vga cable i noticed there was a shadow effect on my screen the vga cable they sent is broken 
quality is as cheap as the price it makes the screen blurry
tae na bulok sayang pera 
for some reasons both vga cables are not connecting properly to a tv unlike other trusted brands the output is too blurry

keri na din di masyadong recommended may sariling buhay yung mouse hahahahaa
masyadong sensitive ung mouse kahit hindi nakadikit sa surface ung sensor at tinry kong imove sumasabay ung cursor which is very annoying 
sira na agad week palang ganda sana eh kaso bigla nalang nagmalfunction dina magamit di gumagana sensor not recommend ed
walang kwenta ang hina di gumagana nang maayus sinira ko na low qaulity pweeee
its not working anymore after ilang days lang
maganda naman sya pero bigla nalang di gumana
mahirap igalaw yung mouse i mean smooth sya kaso kung saan saan pumupunta yu cursor 
sira na agad week palang ganda sana eh kaso bigla nalang nagmalfunction dina magamit di gumagana sensor not recommend ed
product is not really good quality
problem with mouse sensitivity and scroll wheel
walang kwenta ang hina di gumagana nang maayus sinira ko na low qaulity pweeee
its not working anymore after ilang days lang
thank you for its okay good working with mouse nice 
light weight not for gaming normal use ok
dropping button response
nagsstop yung dragging nya sguro dahil wala akong mouse pad but everything else ok maganda sha
its good
i really like how nice the quality is with its affordable price thumbs up to the seller and the product itself the package just arrived early as i thought
the product came securely wrapped and safe i love the keyboard and the mouse it just feels different from the one i used before but youll get use to it the keys are all working fine the lights are so cute i hope it really last long thank you seller good quality product in an affordable price
my order arrived quite fast i was just not expecting it to come only in bubble wrap because thats a first for me but it was still in good condition thanks to the good handling maybe i love the backlit feature of the keyboard that is why i ordered it and all keys are working as for the mouse the mouse is light and functions well too im telling my siblings to order from this shop too thank you so much for the seller and the delivery guy for safe handling of my order take care yall

cuteness overload thank you
very nice everything works perfectly fine my item was shipped immediately and napakabait ng seller kausap thank you so much po 
maganda sya and affordable nagustuhan sya nang anak ko 
wala bang ilaw talaga yung base ng keyboard sir
wellpacked fast delivery i have not tried it yet but i hope the quality is good will update review soon
tell me im not obsessed ang gandaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaq
looks good for its price all working ang keys ng board only issue is ung mouse nung una ayaw nung right click nya then tinry ko pa ulit since baka bago lng kaya mejo matigas pa ngayon both buttons hirap iclick need pa hanapin ung part na gagana 
fast deliver safe with bubble wrap so far s good hope it will last for a longer time kids enjoy the lights at night 
one of the mouse is not working properly theres something wrong with the mouses sensor keycaps of some of the keyboards are detached others are working as expected 
talagang mura naman sakto lang quality ewan basta oks lang wala naman ako pake pero maganda naman hahahahhahahahahahajajajajahhahahahah bili na kayo nahala kayo ahhahahhajaha
well packaged may konting gasgas nga lang yung keybaord pero overall maganda sya for its price sana magtagal
 for the seller because she managed to deliver the product day after the product was placed but the choice of courier is sablay sana nag j t o ninjavan nalang in addition yung bubble wrap nya manipis lng at kung naulan siguradong mababasa yong loob ng packagingfor the courier as they are very slow in delivering the product as compared with other courier kayalang overall rating ko dahil sa mga factors na yan pero dahil mabait si seller plus one dahil sa after sales service
its super late review the item actually delivered days after i ordered i got busy so now lang nakapagreview the packaging is not that very safe naka bubble wrap lang sya at manipis lang but thankfully the item is safe it working well ginamit ko agad agad sya but there are keys na hindi tugma sa nakalagay like shift it should be the sign but lumalabas is wrong but overall its still satisfying 
took some time to use the keyboard first before doing the review so far so good all keys working same with the mouse maganda sya and sulit na sulit for the price 
initial review diko pa nabubuksan at bz pa update bakit nailaw padin kahit naka shutdown
although some keys were detached as shown in the picture mouse and keyboard are operational
ok naman sya
not functioning the keyboard and its clear my order is blk yet u send me a white
 stars lang una kasi yupi yung kahon nya pati keyboard yupi ng onti tapos sobrang nadismaya ako kasi sira yung mouse nakakatamad na irefund pa quality check muna sana bago isend hayz buti nagana yung keyboard
sorry for the late review i hate it kc i usually work madaling araw madilim pa sa kwarto di ko makita yung letter ng keys kahit may rgb light siya mura lang sya so mukhang mumurahin lang talaga sa personal ps sira agad ang mouse few days lang 
may discoloration yung side mabilis naman yung shipping but nakaka dismaya lang kase uellowish yung end part 
dumating ng maaga yung keyboard at nagustuhan ko yun ang kaso lang indi gumagana ung pagiging rgb ng keyboard
so far so good keyboard i know this is a gaming keyboard but i used it for work however ung scroll lock ang gamit to turn on and off the keyboard lights soooooo if you are using excel you need to switch off the light 
maganda ang mga pailaw ng inyong produkto ngunit di ganun kaganda ang kaniyang performance dahil kung minsan ay bigla nalamang dadami ang letra sa screen kahit isang beses lang napindot sensitive
medyo disappointed ako kasi may discoloration yung keyboard sa gilid pero working properly yung mouse yung keyboard din parang normal keyboard lang hindi mechanical 
very disappointed item arrived poorly packed with the box crumpled keyboard is cracked and totally dead tried it in pcs with same result dead took forever to arrive too
walang backlight yung keyboard

legit store ecstatic with the device received it earlier than expected thank you seller 
its the best and legit ive been searching for this coral color and here it is thank you so much for this
legit sealed and wrapped in buble wrapping and tagged as fragile will give this as a gift
genuine and well packed arrived earlier than scheduled delivery seller very responsive easy to link with appliances including tv digibox electric fans air purifier aircon lights lamps etc turned our bedroom into a smart room everything voice controlled
legit napakagandang findeto pinaka mura
original product sealed din sya kaya lang baka matagal na yung stock kaya malagkit na yung parang rubber base kaya s lang mabils naman delivery overall i like the product
the rubberized base is starting to become sticky when i unboxed the item 
working
item is brand new sealed and tested working it was properly packaged and shipped immediately the problem was they sent the wrong colorsku so frustrating when the product name itself has the color and no other variation option other colors are sold as different item so its really annoying and frustrating i reached out and while they were quick to respond we all know the return process is a big hassle and will take time and they dont even offer a voucher to compensate for the mistake and trouble to the one who prepared my order you had one job one job
hindi maganda pairing sa edifier bluetooth speaker ko kapag yung ang preferred kong music output
oki sya magandaalagi ko na nga kinakausap e hahahahaaha asann yung lamann 
the first delivery was fast next orders are not received until now ive ordered units and paid for it already when i follow up fr seller they just give me the hotline number of lazada which cant be contacted at times or sometimes you can get through but the it always say that my order number is invalid the chat link that they gave is just a chatbot that give inaaccurate answers seller doesnt care on aftersales basta lang kumita bahala na kung mareceive o hindi 
hmmm something went wrongthere was a glitch etc please fix this it happened after a few weeks so unresponsive

for its price maganda na yung tunog malakas tsaka malinaw also yung mga saksakan kasama nito like charger and audio jack gumagana naman it also comes with instructions na madali naman intindihin and magaan yung speaker madaling dalhinwill get back here for a review pag nagtagal na pero so far masaya na kami sa speaker na ito 
great quality my cousin loves it and the color will purchase again maganda yung sounds and loud good buy
this tg bluetooth speaker is so good at an affordable price i like it mabass sya very good product tg keep up the good work
ay bongga to lsobrang lakas ng sounds pati ng bass ang linaw pa ng music tagal ko na naghahanap ng magandang speaker na malakas at malinis ung tunog bet na bet ko to ang saya ko lang finally sa murang halaga meron ng maganda speaker i love it 
it works well naman hopefully magtagal and magwork pa din sya for a long time nice quality nice din pagkapackage and no damage at all
quick delivery and item is in good condition sound quality is okay loud but not very clear but its a good buy for its price been using it for a few weeks now buttons were working fine when i tested it on the first time but just recently the next and previous button are not always working volume up and down long press of and works though another observation song sometimes automatically goes next im not sure if its due to yt music or the speaker anyway thanks seller
has great audio and is wellpacked however there has a white stain
the speaker is working and the quality of the sound is very nice i dont know why but i didnt get the design that i want instead of army green i got grey but its still good the packaging is also nice you should buy this product it is worth it 
ok naman sya sakto lang ang lakas buo ang tunog saka ang bilis dumating ng order ko kakaorder ko lang kahapon dumating agad ngayon thanks lazada
maganda ang tunogmalakas din at okey naman sa price niyamagaan siya stars lang kasi di ko alam kong tatagal
mabilis malobat at sabog ayos lang naman dahil tumutunog naman sya at un ang importante as long as di ka nakakaapak ng tao yun lang and i thank u pinahaba ko lang para sa coins salamat
overall experience meh good for boosting sound for netflix or youtube or even games not really bassy in terms of sound quality with music
mabilis malowbat at hindi rin sya ganun kalakas pero maganda ang quality ng speaker hindi sabog ang tunog nya
ok lang nman siya for the price dont expect too much when it comes to the sound quality
 stars muna kasi gusto ko pang itest ung ilang araw baka kasi biglang masira yung tunog nya maganda hindi sabog at masakit sa tenga yung lakas naman okay sya sa mga kulob na space like kwarto pero tingin ko pag nasa open space na sya mejo mahina for the price naman na pesos okay na okay na din sya wag lang sana masira agad
super ganda ng soundsmura pasalamat sa inyo at sa nag deliver kaso after days at twice ko nagamitna trace ko na mabilis malow batoct yan unang testing second used ko ginamit ko na sya sa biyahe sa bikenag putol putol ang tunog ng speackerat mga hour lng low bat agaddi ko na nagamit ng pauwi akopapunta lng sa gym mga mins at pag pauwi na k wala na low bat na

sulit ang buy take pa thankyou seller sa simpleng pagpack at ky dilivery rider na nagiging suki na din ako haha sa maingat na pagdadala ng mga items thankyou 
salamat po nakarating naman po ng maayos ang product walang bubble wrap ang product pero nagana naman po siya na testing ko na rin siya maganda gumagana naman po salamat po sa uulitin po 
well packed naman naman un package though hindi sya nakabubble wrap for extra protection good thing hindi sya na damage in any aspect star for giving me one earphone na parehas na pang left earhaha natawa nalang ako instead of mainis or what good thing is gumagaan pareho at mabilis ang delivery iingatan ko nalang thank you
iba yung earphones na nasa picture at yung dumating sakin pero both working naman 
received parcel in good condition manipis at mukhang di tatagal depende din sa gagamitminsan nawawala yun sound sa kabilaok nadin sakto lang sa price niya
iba dun sa dati ko nabili wala man lang maayos ma packaging yung dati naka box pa sira pa yung isa headset di nagana haysss 
dumating naman kaso ung dalawang headset di gumagana kung irereturn hassle pa magbabayad pa for shippingkaya nga bumili ng mura kc di afford ang mahal tpos mapapamahal pa sa return shipping fee
dumating na ung order ko gumagana naman pero hinde sya nka bubble rap buti walang nasira pero ok na rin 
kya pla buy one take one sira ung isa
 stars po kase i expected na pang oppo po yung earphones instead the seller gave me esom na earphones ayos naman po yung sound pero ambilis masira 
very nice colors but takes layers for best color payoff the brush is flat and slightly curved which makes it easy to apply overall worth it for the price
mabilis lang dumating naka sealed pa ng magagos maliban sa mismong sealed ng nail polish ang gabda ng kulay at nabili ko lang for only pesos
watery formula this it needs at least layers suitable color for morena girls the photo of my nail looks messed up but it has a good color tho i just tried to see what it looks like on an actual nail
bench and beauty nail polish safe packaging authentic bench products long lasting for the price color not yet tested
super bilis maship and well packaged din nung pagkadating kaso medyo watery siya kaya nahirapan akong kunin yung desired color ko 
hindi ko nagustuhan consistency ng nailpolish nakailang pahid aq bago makuha desired color na black hindi katulad ng ibang color isang swipe lang ganda na
packed securely with bubble wrap and delivered on time ang ganda ng mga reviews so im excited to try sayang lng wla un pinaka gusto ko n shade which is clay 
price ok quality ok package ok love the shade suits fair morena skin tone
nice color
watery siya at tsaka pag nilagay mo sa nail mo may nakikita pero ok lang kasi kala ko black na black ehh 
ordered black red teal and ultramarine i love that the colors have good coverage in coats except black black is so sheer and i thought its unfair its like this compared to other colors black cant even be opaque in coats i suppose it has a different purpose i wish bench will redo formula for black as for other colors worth the price packaging was well done
oks lang di good quality pero pede na
please take time to read my reviewi know its kinda long but its worth reading i promise truthrevealed product liquid consistency he nail polish itself is too watery needs to have about coatings to fully cover the nail the good thing naman is its so shiny after color of choice i think bagay naman siya for a morena like me fragrance just like all the other nail polishes mabaho rin naman but its fine suggestion lang hehe sana they can lessen the bad scent packaging its so pretty very aesthetic but when i shake it parang may tumutunog sa loob i bet its the applicator applicator very soft gets maraming product which is good delivery i just ordered it yesterday but it arrived today super fast this is my fastest order ever from lazada hahaha
fast shipping and its very affordable compared sa other shops it works sa sobrang dikit nya nabunot yung pilikmata ko hahahaha my fault though panget lang nung box so wag mag expect
great buy very strong adhesive indeed the best one i found so far will surely purchase again soon thanks
magnda po packaging tas bagung bago thanks lazada and to seller for fast transaction sa uulitin po i love it
napaka ganda talaga ng product na ito kase wala ka kang makitang male kase almost perfectly na sya
maganda po syaaaa madikit
thankyouuu

shipping was fast and as per usual manong delivery guy was very friendly and courteous but the product itself tho i havent tried it yet was very poorly packed as you can see in the photo the box containing the product was already open when i took it out of the plastic so i cannot give this a five star rating sorry maybe next time you can put plastic to seal it or a bubble wrap
i dont try it yet pero sana ok sya
the glue sticks on my lid but good atleast doesnt hurt when i remove falsies from my eyelashes and very nice
havent tried yet if this is more adhesive than nichido but im disappointed with the packaging there is no bubble wrap considering that the product may leak the container itself doesnt have seal with it too a famous vlogger made me buy this but now im questioning myself if this is a legit product or not
the seller was very considerate sa refund request ko
bubble wrap nyo naman
these products are great and worth to keep this set is perfect for my nomakeup look style i love my set thank you seller
i am very satisfied with the products great quality despite its very affordable price what you see is what you get and there were no damages upon shipping the packaging is also very cute i cant wait to buy more products soon thank you 
thank you so much it was so cute and i never thought that your makeup is very much appropriate to my skin
was delivered fast very cheap considering there were items sent very satisfied thanks
st time magkamake up ng pinkflash ang ganda po talagatas ang tagal pa ng expiration nya w bag pa at dun ako natuwa sa bubble wrap nya kakaiba super safe talagathankyou seller tsaka kay rider at sa lazada godbless all

i really love the product cant wait to try it on i receive the shade that i want i recommend this shop so muchi it is well package also i buy this contour with pinkflash concealer and i got a free pinkflash lipgloss it took a week to deliver my parcell but the product is nice thanks sellerwill definetely buy again in your shop
i like the shade it is
okie po ung highlighter ang ganda ng items sobra na amaze po q kc good quality po xa for everyday
super affordable and maganda naman yung products nakikita ko yung purpose nya thankyou seller photo not related kasi po ginamit at pinangregalo na
for the price okay lang yung size and is creamy would recommend for beginners or trying out contour
didnt know everything will be small lol my fault for not reading the description everything works good tho
wrong item i order contour in the shade of but instead i received highlighter 
good for beginners its not that dark halos kakumay lang siya ng skin care ko im actually expecting it to be darker pero keri na 
upon using this product for quite some time now i like how it has a glittery effect that shines and has awesome smell
damaged yung lagayan ng isa di naiikot
well packaged kaso di ko bet parehas kasi di kita medyo sa mukha
i havent tried it but i think its nice however i hate how it smells it smells badly hahahaha anyway thank you 
its creamy not suitable for people woth oily skin the pigmentation is okay but would definitely not last long but seems okay for its price 
hindi man lang naka bubblewrap good thing walang damage ung item 
i thought it has a highlighter but the bronzer is good
very gorgeous product araw araw ko ginagamit naka fresh lagi at naka ganda sa tiktok salamat seller
grabe ang ganda niya sa mukha unlike sa ibang ganito thank youuuusa susunod oorder ulit ako kapag naubos

super friendly budgettpos nka sale pa then maayos na dumating yung parcel ko cguradong di ka mag ssisi sa pag order
it kinda irritate my skin perhaps im sensitive to this 
items arrived in good condition the product doesnt work with me as advertised soim not that satisfied it doesnt covermy dark spots
overrated sabi authentic pero di namn nya nacoconceal mga imperfection sa what the description says mabango lang sya credits na lng din na tama at kumpleto yung item pero overall not satisfied
havent give a proper review since hindi ko pa siya ginagamit talaga i cant say na talagang matatakpan niya yung marka sa balat kasi nung sinubukan ng kapatid ko di man na cover yung peklat niya visible parin hindi katulad nung nasa advertisement nila 
tagal dumating ng item tapos may basag pasomehow disappointed not sure kung sa shipping handling o sa seller kasi d rin sya nka bubble wrap for added protection sana
ok naman mabilis na dumating ang items mesyo disappointed lang kasi sira yung box nung pang regalo ko pa naman sana saka medyo iba yung amoy nung sira ang box sana check nyo ng maayos before nyo ipadala
the item was not as described i received it days ago and i just used it today and it wasnt waterproof or smudge free when i wiped off the sweat the bb cream came off as well not happy with your product false advertisment as well
attention wag kayo mag oorder makati sa muka nkaka pimples putinaimbes wla ako pimples sandamakmak lumabas bwiset
it does not live up to how its advertise
ang hirap i open nasira tuloy ang takip 
eventhough i ordered the shade natural color it still looks lighter and the foundation doesnt sit on my face maybe it was because i am acidic howeverit causes breakouts on my face so i stop using this
attention wag kayo mag oorder makati sa muka nkaka pimples putinaimbes wla ako pimples sandamakmak lumabas bwiset
i cant use it because its broken 
i did not receive my order
i did not recieve the item please i want to refund my money or just send me the item please or else its a waste of money 
does not conceal anything what a waste of money
mganda xa at lagi ku ginagamit sorry late review lng po bibili pa aku uli nagustuhan ku xa

thank u very much lazada and sace lady received item in good condition fast delivery 
maganda sya super nagustuhan ko second order kona yan tagala din matanggal
item is good but wrong color tsk tsk well thanks anyway
responsive si seller mabilis ang delivery black brown pro medyo light ang shade im looking sana na mas darker shade so far ok nman for its price medyo madali rin syang mabura di sya pang long lasting 
its fine i guess dark brown isnt that dark brown for me considering i have deep deep dark brown almost black filo virgin hair but not bad tho i only use it to fill in some areas that has less hair 
thank you seller and kay kua nag deliver maganda po sya 
ok nmn sya kaso pangit lang yng pagkaka dark grey nyapara lang syang brown ang layo sa pagka dark grey tsk so very dissapointed
thank you the product seems nice i should have ordered also the gray one i will wear it nicely 
ngaun lng nkpg feedback natapon ko na po karton nya ganda po nyan mtagal po matanggal
seller is not responsive but buti nalang i got the right shades and products thank you i love these eyebrow pencils 
k naman sya mabilis nga lang din matanggal di sya tumatagal sa kilay pwede na for its price 
ok naman sya for the price kaya lang super dali mag smudge also yung both ends spoolie and the liner magkaiba ng size ng takip in terms of length if youre not careful enough like me youll end up putting the cap for the spoolie dun sa side ng liner which will cause the product to be smushed sadtttt
nice ang ganda
sakto lang pede na 
ok naman isang piraso lang pala kala ko madamipero maganda syafirst time ko magtry nito
all items correct except for the liquid eyeshadow instead of a liquid eyeshadow you sent me matte lip ink these two items are completely different i would understand if you sent me a different shade pls seller check the items first before shippibg to your clients
thank you lazada seller kahit matagal po yung delivery maganda nman yung item 
love it
approachable yung seller nagmessage agad sya sakin na may damage yung order ko kaya napalitan din matagal nga yung dating siguro dahil ecq and holy week ayos naman yung product hindi nga lang sya ganun kasmooth kapag ginagamit ko nagkakaroon ng mga bumps pero over all okay sya
item shipped quickly hard to draw my brows but im satisfied might buy again 
ok nmanbkt nd po malinaw nun tnry ko potnxz po sa seller at ngdeliver
ok sya para sakin maganda thanks seller at sa suki ko na delivery boy
ok un brown pero un light diko guatothanks seller
masyado creamy yung formula di sya pwede for oily skin like me yung color mas dominant yung brown so i would say na parang wala sila pinagkaiba sa brown shade tlga 
maganda xa
okay naman sya medyo darker lang which is gusto ko medyo light 
not bad for the price
maganda naman siya madaling iapply and iblend sana lang hindi siya madaling maubos
maganda nman sya gamitin sana wag lang agad maputolpra mka order againsalanat seller at kay kuyang nagdeliver
hindi grey ang kulay ng product mejo dark brown siya nkaka sad coz dalawa pa naman binili ko pero okay na rin kasi sale naman nakuha haha bebenta ko na lang sa tita ko na mahilig sa brown na pangkilay

ok naman ang tela mukhang maliit size nila pang bata add size na ako pero maliit ung pang to nila na white tshirt
i should have given stars however they sent wrong size from the sets i ordered the fabric is good for the kids 
ok naman sana malambot yong shirt kaso yong isa po may damage sya ehmay butas at mantsa
size is too small seems sizing of organics is really not consistent may inorder ako medium and large shirts mas malaki pa ung medium s large 
sa size ok sa size masyadong maliit
reasonably priced but not the type of cotton fabric i was hoping for 
nakarating dinmedyo natagalan lang magada din sana ang tela kaso nakupas ang kulay nitong asul
the size is small for years old should order size higher
parehas nmn inorder ko but diff colors kaso ang sikip non blue mas malaki at maluwag un black
smaller than expected
the quality is not what i was expecting not like the adults shirts quality
fast delivery pero manipis ang tela nitong white compare dun sa mga unang naorder ko dati na colored quite disappointed
small for my almost yrs old kid 
maganda naman ang quality kaso kso packaging nya niya di hindi d presentable d ka plastic ang mga tshirt sama sama lng sa isang lalagyankhit yung free nlng sanayung d nka plastic tpos yung iba nka plastici buy peso gusto ko pa sana mag dagdag ng pc kso magagastos pa ko ng plastic na paglagan ng tshirt 
may stain sya maganda sana ang tela kaso ang laki ng yellow stain parang old stock

fits just right thank youuuuuuuuu seller lazada thank youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
the items itself is good although not perfect yung stitches nya ay na tatastas and daming thread na natatatngal
okay naman mjo makapal ang tela double check kc yun isang na received ko may damaged okay naman ang iba stars
okay naman yung product well packed namn nung binigay ng courier and concern ko lng is sobrang fit pla talaga nya akala ko medyo maluwag luwag 
quality is worth its price 
not bad for the price i paid for it
maliit po pla ang size nla ok sna kso sktongx sya
makapal yung tela tyaka ok siya sa presyo niya although diko expect na maliit ung pants ako kaya maliit tuloy sakin stars sana kung medyo mahaba pa
it doesnt fit my waistline is thats why i got this but pants are way way smaller ugh

good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good
maganda quality kaso lang medyo manipis and walang nakalagay na brand kung crown sya 
maganda yung kulay pero yung sa tela saktuhan lang
ayos naman the textile quality is still good for both rust and jungle my only concern is that may butas na maliit sa jungle naway maging maayos na sa susunod because ive ordered here many times nevertheless i wont go for replacement or what since mas magiging hassle pa iyon
just received my order i didnt expect it to be delivered that fast i like the quality of the shirt but the only problem is that i ordered black but they gave me khaki but still stars overall 
small ung inorder ko pero medium ung dumating cardinal rose pinili ko kasi ito lang ung may small na trip kong kulay tapos ndi rin pala small ung size na makukuha ko haha sana po next time paki check maigi ung sizes hehe
ganda maganda yung tela and color and nakakagwapo siya emz hahaha nagustuhan sjya ng bf ko so thumbs up 
all goods sya sakto lang yung kapal nya at sulit sya di sayang pera ko dito hahahahhahahahhahahhahahhah
ganda ng tela more than what i have expected kaso sobrang tagal na ship out maybe next time kung oorder ako di sa sale time kasi sobrang dami daw ng orders sa kanila na compromised kung kelan madedeliver over all magaganda ang tela
no cap but its nice 
regarding po sa order ko bale nadismaya po ako dahil sa mali mali ang mga order na dumating bale yung order kong small oversized tshirt pero ang dumating po ay only small at medium size at mali pa ang color na ibinigay pero okay lang po meron daw system glitch kaya pinalitan nalang ang order ko yun nga lang medium yung dalawa diko magagamit
mabilis nadeliver and maganda yung tela stars sana kaso may damage yung rust sana po check niyo muna yung item bago iship pinicturan ko at vinideo yung damage 
yung quality ng tela goods kaso ang pangit ng pagkakatahi sa bandang kili kili nd time ko na umorder dito kung hindi wrong color nadeliver ganito naman yung pagkakatahi 
 stars only becuase i ordered items and only items delivered i already pay it in advance sadddd 
wrong color neckline was a bit closefitted
hahaha anlaki pala ng medium pero ok na din naman
okay naman sya average quality of the fabric but the size is good as oversize naman tlaga bilis din dumating 
not what i expected stars 
maganda naman yung item walang damage hindi naman siya pure cotton tsaka balingag naman yung nag pack kasi mali yung kulay
i ordered medium for both shirts but you gave small for one shirt how can i have this replaced
okay sana kaso may butas eh sayang pero wlaanako magagawa nasuot ko na
masyado malaki
bakit mas manipis ang fabric ng khaki color and ang daming sinulid na hindi pulido ang tahi 
bakit mga large ang dumating medium size ang order ko sana hindi puro benta ang inisip natin kahit hindi masayahan ang buyer nyo mali ang size mas marami pa ang mali kesa sa tama 
may butas sa tagiliran yung isang damit 
wrong size received
order ko po sir ay medium size pero yung dumating xl sobrang laki po
i ordered large and xl pero dalawang xl dumating i even messaged the seller first before giving a low rating since para maayos privately sabi magbbigay nalang daw ng voucher to compensate and i dont need to return the product na daw to replace nagbigay ng voucher di rin naman gumagana and di na nagrreply sa chat lol anw will never order again god bless
hindi sya cardinal rose magkaiba sa kulay ng picture 
 star lang hindi nasunod yung order ko na color sorry seller di mo sisnonod order ko na color nakaka inis ang ganda ng pinag usapan na color peru palpak
ordered colors but one color was delivered wrongly l should be black but they gave blue 
seller gave me a wrong color there was an apology note but have to return it because i dont like it im okay with replacement but the seller could have just contacted me prior and asked what color of the replacement i like instead 
dalawang item inorder ko isang kulay brown and grey brown lang yung tamang kulay tapos hindi grey yung isa kulay mint green kaya star lang hays sa susunod paki check muna ng maayos hays
maraming maraming salamat po sa damit saktong sakto sa mukha ko naging face mask ko na
ano to lang hiya kaya nawawalan ng tiwala yung mga tao sa inyu eh 
i did not open it yet cause i am still upset i waited for it to be delivered as it says its out for delivery yet the delivery man just left the parcel in the gate doesnt care anymore if it will be received since it was already paid what if a passerby got it the worse so dishonest to even affix a signature as proof of delivery please see photos as proofs
maganda naman kaso black pinadala siraulu ba 
although tama yung colorway ng shirt na nadeliver sakin pero mali ung sizing ang order ko is cardinal rose na small but large ung na received ko and mocha na large pero xl ung pinadala ang tama lng is ung black na medium see pictures for reference ng dumating and nung order ko
wrong item and size was delivered 
ang ganda ng clothe at color kaso labo niyo naman parehong small size ang order medium yung isang pinadala niyo 
i ordered three different shirts only of them arrived here correctly one is in wrong size and the other is not the color i ordered and wrong size too
mas mura po sa shop na ito kesa sa ibang shop maganda po ung kmakapal po siya nag order nga po ulit ako kasi nagustuhan koh mga products nila

the item was shipped and delivered on time based on the estimated delivery date the quality of the masks is a bit thin but ofcourse for the price since its cheap maybe i should not expect a good quality item the item was packed well and was delivered complete 
delivered siya earlier than the expected date of delivery sulit mo naman ang bayad mo 
video and photos are not related but your product is highly recommended thank you po seller at kay kuya na nagdeliver photo and vid are not related thank you po seller ang ganda po ng facemask

salamat po sa courier pero yung items po nakakadisappoint po kasi manipis at nasira agadhindi natahi or nadikit
dati naman na akong kumukuha dito ng mask repeat order na ito pero pumangit ang quality manipis na at medyo maliit
according to the photos on the post this face mask is ply but when i cut it open to check if it is really ply lo and behold it is only ply i was really confused as it is too thin when i tried it on i bought it because on the photos it shows ply dont deceive people 
i received the item very poor quality it seems that it is only one ply and can still smell the smoke from outside no wonder it is cheap because of poor quality never buy this items from this store so disappointing and frustrating i am really angry i did not waste my money to receive this kind of item
looks used masks hastily repacked first time i have encountered mask being sold in this condition all my order sets are of the same condition waste of time waiting and money i rarely review very poor because i manage my expectation but this is really unacceptable the thinnest quality i have ever bought
disappointed sa facemasks nalamukos see video
napakanipis wag kayong manniwala sa mga comment dami kong inorder kasi kala ko totoo yng reviews sa lahat ng nabili kong mask eto pnakamanipis at pnaka pangit
no good ung mga mask manipis tapos amoy pintura pa di ko man nagamit mga mask ang dami ko pa man din inorder 
i order packs days deliver agad to my surprise to check items manipis na nga then it looks like may amag and not color navy blue actually its faded n prang nilabhan itsura i sent message to seller wala nmn response dina ako uulit at sa mga makakabasa neto wag na balaking order pa haist di dpe recommend they not even checked items before bigay sa magddliver ng items poor business gawa niyo

xl na kinuha ko maliit pa din and wrong color pa dark grey naging blue next time kung wala na kayo ng ganun color much better to put sold out sign not recommended kayo ok na sana yung tela and everything pero yung size tsaka yung kulay sablay
sizeway too small materialthin material for a xl ft in length starting waistline but accdg to their ad large starts at my son is with a waistline i thought getting a size higher would be on the safe side but it wasnt another nightmare has come beware 
sizewag kayo umorder dito scammer dalawang xxl order ko yung isa pinilit na maging xxl tinanggal yung proof ng size para malaman kung ano yung original na size dahil maliit sya sa xxl
hnd yata marunong mgbasa ang seller makabinta lng khit anu na mabalot ang bobo nyo ang tatanga nyodark gray gray ang pinadala d ba kau marunong tuningin ng kulay ngaral ba kau bobo nyo wag na kau mg order sa seller na ito bobo mkabinta lng khit anu babalutin nila

ano ba yannakakadisappoint kayo ayosin nyo po trabaho nyo kasi malimali ang pinapadala nyo order ko po ay xl na color grey ang pinadala nyo red xl pa maliit sa akin buti na lng may mapagkakasyahang kapatid nawawala ang trust sa inyo pagka ganyan ang gagawin nyo kaya ayusin nyo po sana sa susunod na mga order nyo yun lng masasabi ko para sa inyo rin yan
order ko xxl na maroon 
sellers items are not true to size descriptioned xxxl does not fit for plus size women or like me that is pregnant its has a very petite waistline good only for skinny person and the fabric is super thin that it will easily rip off just half month maximum life span
pls lang wag kayo mag order sa store na to clearly l large ang order m medium ang dumating kasalanan ko rin napaka panget na talaga review sa store na to pero nag bakasakali ako na tama ang ipapadala at the end nabiktima rin ako ng pang gogoyo nila sa costumer wag na kayo gumaya sakin maliit na halaga pero perang pinag hirapan kitain 
i ordered black but seller sent me blue no response from them at all 
tatlong xl order ko pero tong dumating small size pano po isusuot to ng asawa ko hehe sayang dikk rin magagamit masyadong maliit

delivered the wrong size chat the seller already pero seen zone lang ako will update the review if irerefundchange nila item without additional charges nkakainis
all items na inorder ko mali yong ipinadala ni seller may maipadala lang kahit hindi nman yon yong order mo instead na dark gray light gray ipinadala others wrong item na nga wrong size pa and yet seller doesnt bother to reply sa message masasayang lang pera mo

sobrang ganda mg tela mas maganda kesa sa jockey mas mura pa sulit talaga rd time ko ng bumili dito
ganda ng tela cotton at tama sakin ang size
correct sizing and color good clothes it is really comfy to wear
ok ang tela kado medyo msikip hindi xa kapatehas ng grey though parehas silang large
medyo mataas yung pag ka v neck nya dapat pang undershirt ko kaso kita sya malambot tela pero hindi niform ang size kahit parehong medium
decent wear good fabrics not sheer color is really good i am giving this a because they gave me one round shirt when in fact i ordered all v neck other than that i like my purchase thank you
bakit ang haba ng sleeves yung ibang color naman okey maigsi na pang ladies
ordered a vneck tshirt but received a round neck tshirt they did sent a letter inside the package but i would really appreciate it if they informed me first before sending
got the right color and size but the old rose is round neck iv ordered vneck 
maganda yung tela malamig sa katawan and stretchable po siya kasya sa anak ko na mataba kahit medium lang
legit cotton ang fabric ng shirtna dsappoint lng ako kc may portion ng tagiliran na butastahiin nlng kesa hassle ang mgsauli at request ng refund
sizethe size l is like a medium designbasic materialpresko hindi mainit fo reference im kgs in waist in hip usually a size medium buti l ang kinuha ko para may konting allowance for movement presko ang fabric the shirts stitching is my issue good but it could be better sana naka tuck inside man lang yung edges ng hem see pic for the price i paid though pwede na din pero i would gladly pay a bit more price if only to get a much more pulido na tahi that said i am not sure how long it will take bago matastas ang hems hence the stars
i ordered black but they delivered gray ok naman yung tela
love the shirts materialquality is superb delivery was fast however of the shirts had longer sleeves wonder if these are for ladies though
ok nman ang tela
super bilis dumating ng parcel two days lang dumating na small po talaga ang size ko but i order medium tamang tama lang saken di masikip di rin maxiado maluwag ayaw ko kasi ng fitted na tshirt mejo awkward lang ang sleeve ng tshirt kasi an liit at mejo maiksi sa normal na tshirt
butas ung kilikili tinahi ko pa
okay yung tela better order size up
nagustuhan ko yung quality ng tela maganda sya cotton ang hindi ko lang nagustuhan ay maliit ang size nila xl kinuha kaso parang medium to large frame lang hindi akma sa measurement details nyo
maganda yung tela kaso maliit yung size nya yung xl para lang syang small to semi medium buti nalang dumating agad bago mag birthday si lazada order sana ulit ako kaso maliit sya
i ordered vneck but got the round neck instead
ok lng im satisfiedthnk you seller lazada also d rider
im wondering if its really cotton bec it doesnt feel cool wearing it
nice cotton talaga meron nga lang konting part sa may arm na di natahi pero madali namang tahian thank you seller
nagustuhan ko ang tela maganda sya kaso lang magkaiba lang yung sizes medium and small dumating sa akin
fabric is thick and stitching is good if i may suggest ladies vneck shirt maybe enhanced by adding the usual waist curve instead of just straight shorter sleeves and wider vneck cut
my mom liked it
ok na pambahay presko
good qulity medyo mahaba lang ang manggas
 star kasi i order vneck medium but i received round neckstill good quality
di pala ganon kakapal according sa reviews dito 
pweds na very fast delivery tho
maliit masyado yung size for medium but i like the fabric
good product
ok item gusto ko

i order vneck but you send round neck
quality were excellent my concern is the size which s too small compared to other brand i ordered m since i always got this size with other brand but your size is smaller 
mukhang pang pe uniform ok lang naman pero pang bahay lang tlaga
the material is good presko isuot however ang sizing is a hit and miss i ordered a round neck as well as vneck both in medium size yung v neck sakto at comfortable ang fit while the round neck one was tight parang small size lang both shirts were labeled medium
medyo makapal nman ang tela at maayos ang tahi medyo mahaba lng sya sa akin
medyi masikip lang sa size ko n medium pero okay naman
con medyo masikip sa armhole pro malambot yung tela maganda yung packaging fast delivery
i ordered l but the deliver xl in white for red same ordered s but shipped medium the quality of fabric is excellent though
maliit ang sizing nila hnd kasya saken buti na lang kasya sa pamangkin ko anyway thanks seller and courier
okay naman ang quality
maganda tela at cotton tlga siya 
fast delivery makapal tela
nakakalungkot mas manipis na sya ngaun kumpara sa dati tapos ung dalawang white may mantsa nextym paki double check mabuti
mgnda quality ng tshirt but nxt tym lagyan nyo plastic ung tshirt lalo nat white order s inyo
good quality
ok naman ang telamasyadong fit lng para sa mga small
ok naman soft ang tela pero medyo manipis not like the first white one that i bought
the quality of the shirt is super nice a bit disappointed lang kasi walang plastic yung ibang shirts when i recceived them nkalagay sila in between dun sa may plastic sana man lng ng improvise na lang si seller ng plastic para presentable and neat sha
it looks ok fabric looks comfortable im just not sure if i chose the correct size cause it looks kinda big
maganda sana kaso ang liit mg size hindi po accurate ang size chart please improve
sizing is smallxl is fitted for medium size nevertheless will still give them stars for the nice fabric
its true that their sizes are small so better get the next size but the fabric is good
very good quality but size comes smaller than the published size
ok siyaang tela magandathumbs up
good quality pero medyo masikip yung size large 
i received the item the quality was good and it was delivered on time
soft and comfy
maganda ang quality ng tela malambot at medyo stretchable pero masyadong maliit yung size hindi tama yung sa details
maganda yung damithindi sya ganun ka nipiskaso pangalawang order ko na to pagdating sakin hindi na maayos ang pagka pack nyapero ok na rin
magandang quality ang tela 
small size bit stretchable
good job satisfied customer thank you organic ok ang nrecieve q cotton tlg prang authentic xa s uulitin
very nice but sizing i little small
tinahi ko na lang sana mawala sa laba yung stain
layo s acolor na ineexpect ko akala ko royal blue talaga pero its just blue although mganda nmn ung fabric kso nakka disapoint lng talaga ung color na ineexpect sana e malayo ng order pa nmn ako ng pcs para sa mga froends kolakala din kse nila real royal bluesna s asuaunod be specific nalang s amga color para d kmi nadidisappoint kapag dumadting 
the colors look all the same different from whats on the photos
though the material is not what i expected delivery is fast efficient thank you
sad to say maliit sa akin kaya kung maorder po kayo adjust nyo one size larger cguro anyway thanks
the size is too small for medium 
iba sa mga nauna kong purchased kita sa tela at eteketa
small ang size though the fabric is nice
pambahay ang dating
nagkukupas yung blue na shirtnde matibay ang tahi butas kagad nung nilabhan
mainit ang tela akala ko ba citton
wrong color recieved grey 
not cotton its cotton seda type
ang laki ng sizing 
sizing is a bit smaller than expected
its more of an inner shirt andor a pambahay shirt because of the texture
although this is a white shirt fabric is not thin like other shirts that are almost see thru get one size bigger as the shirt is on the smaller side
too big for me pero okay na din
the size and too small saka manipis yung tela
manipis at maliit ang size
sewing quality needs improvement though fast delivery 
mganda fittings nia kaso kamalinlang ako mg napili ng size maliit saken ung small dat cguro medium order ko
i ordered v neck but round neck came hmmm
bit smaller size should have been order much larger size fabric is good ordered two products that are different in color but checking it out at the same time kinda dissapointed that i had to pay shipping fee twice which is almost the same price of the product
fabric very comfortable
maganda ang tela kaya lang maliit ang xl sana magkaroon ng xxl or xxxl
material is soft and thick but the fit is awkward i got a couple of sizes bigger as advised by other users but the fit is still not good the shirt is too straight i think
ang liit ng large nila pero ok ung t shirt
the size is smaller than expected sayang mura sana
texture is nice for its price
maganda ang tshirts lima inorder ko may mali lang ng isang size imbis na large naging xl double check next time thanks
i cant use it because the size is too small the quality is quite good though
mganda nmn tela mdulas kaso manipis need mopa ng white bra or skin tone kc kitang kita
ok lang hindi ganun kaganda ang tela pero pwede na sa presyo
may damage po yung isang item xl
marumi ung shirt parang may sulat pa ng ballpen sana lang matanggal pa
kentucky order ko pero hindi kentuky dumating tapos meduim size small binigay nyo
hehenaexcite pa naman akong buksan taz sira pala un itemnagchat aq sa seller voucher worth pesos lng ang kaya nilang ibigayhahaeh di wow inyo na p nyo
disappointed i ordered for vneck shirt they shipped round neck 
wrong color receivednot v neck too
items are mistakenly packed i ordered pcs cotton vneck white ladies large size but i received mens large sizes so much disappointed 
quality fabric is okay worksmanship is nah
may sira sya sayang dahil totoong cotton nmn
nice t shirt pero walang quality control kasi may stain ung t shirt
hindi man lang nag double check if may sira ang item nakakadisappoint kasi butas yung sa may sleeve underarm
wrong item sent they do not know the difference between round vs v neckthen when you return the product they dont know how to honor it they will cancel the return so you have no choice but to bear with the wrong itemtsk
yung nauna kong inorder complete and true to sizes pero yung next order ko same size pinadala pero di na nasunod yung sizing maliit na yung isa
maganda ang tela kaya lang hindi accurate ang sukat nila xl inorder ko puro xl nga ang dumating magkakaiba nman ng laki
legit nga ito st time ko umorder hindi ako nabigoyeheyyy thankyou po seller i will order more order na rin kayo cottonnagustuhan din ng anak ko napakapresko sa katawan swak na swak ito thankyou thankyou thankyou 
after several successful orders ngayon kung kelan madami tsaka pumalpak late na mali mali pa itemhayys
items are good quality but item handling services are very poor missing items incorrect color and sizes item return not allowed store is not ready for bulk orders it would appease if the refund was converted to wallet but voucher for your store just made it more disappointing sa hassle na napagdaanan ko for sure di na ulit ako bibili sa inyo im so sorry i have to give this stars only
its not cotton its something you can buy sa bangketa sa divi disappointed
bad experience we requested to return the items we ordered from organic they approved of the return and so we sent the items to lbc with the return number only to find that our return request has been cancelled i wonder how did that happen so ngayon wala na yung item sa amin tapos di pa naibalik yung ibinayad namin we never experience this to other shirt shops only here in organic balik tuloy ako sa crown shirt wherein okay na okay ang crown sa aftersalecustomer service sayang yung ibinayad namin ibalik niyo yung ibinayad namin please lang never again to this seller bad aftersale service 
please pa update namn items ang binayaran qoh items lang ang pinadala since july pa aqo nagsabi ng concern ung selller laging i will check ang reply araw araw 
this was not included in the first parcel so i followed it up but unfortunately in the nd parcel the seller sent me a mens underwear instead of white shirt the items is good quality but the processing of the order wasnt good
too small medium yata to for kids 
i ordered red and blue both large size but in actual they are not same size and tagged large size on shirt both
material too thick and not suitable for warm weather
their size small is way smaller than other brands jockey bench etc the stitches arent as good also well maybe because its cheaper
maliit yung sizes di kasya sakin
sabi ko xl mali ang nadeliver large ang binigay
ito yung part ng order ko na may butas yung tshirt sa likod
color was not followed
im a cotton user and im sure that this is not cotton as you mentioned sana wag nlng po maglagay ng organic kng hnd nman at ang tahi sobrang hnd maayos not recommended
hindi maganda ang tela sakto sa presyo nya mainit din naman ang tshirt pambahay
wrong size sa isang tshit ung pinadala siguro kasi out of stock na ung size na inorder ko pero nagsabi man lang
manipis masyado
xl is too small
maganda yung shiet pero yung packaging hindi maganda nadumihan na yung damit kasi naka pack
ordered for medium but their sizes were very small ordered items such a waste of money
i ordered one size bigger than my usual shirt size but still too small for me
not pack well and slightly dirty
i am medium to large frame so i ordered large to make sure pero di parin kasya the fabric is not stretchy and the stitches is poor quality
not packed po i dont know why sana po inayos pag pack kasi iisipin po ng buyer na used item na po
manipis kita yung bra
unsatisfied 
maganda tela pero di pantay ang tahi ng v sa harap 
hnd n sya klad ng yna q g inorder tas wla png plastic bwat isa tinipid tlga
okay naman yung tela kaso sa delivery nagkaproblema ang order ko pcs pero pcs lang dumating tapos isang item lang ang may packaging
panget e
pang girl order ko pero pan lalaki dumatinganlaki tuloy pakicheck naman po
sana kung wala ng stock ang vneck wag na sabihin last stock na may available pa sabi ko na round neck ang marereceive ko kasi matagal na naubusan ng vneck maging honest n lang sana tayo if out of stock na talaga at sobra tagal ipaship hindi ko alam if oorder pa ako ng large size kasi baka round neck n naman ipadala v neck tlaga ang gusto ko tsk tsk
poor quality
kelan pa naging round neck ang vneck at kelan pa naging medium ang large kung wala kayo available na item sabihin nyo nag select pa ako ng order kung kayo din pala masusunod 
i ordered items i only receive nakakadisappoint
very poor items pa nmn order ko 
tatlo order ko white yellow prehas lahat ng size na xl pero yung yellow na order ko maliit large lang binigay nakakainis diko man magagamit nakakadala umorder sainu
white ang order ko pinadala nyo gray marunong ba kayo magbasaang layo naman ng white sa gray
mali ung dumating
ang order ko v neck pero lahat ng diniliver saken lahat round neck at ang order ko xl pero large ang dumating matagal na tpos mali pa
nagttaka lang ako bakit wla packaged yung white ko order yung dalawa shirt na black nakapackaged naman prang sinuksuk lang bigla e nakkasad

mali ung order n dumatingvneck order q round ung dumatingska may mga mantsa halatang old stock
may small yellow stain ung sa neck parang ndi xa dumaan sa quality contro at hindi xa naka packed tulad nung gray shirt kong order
kaya siguro mura kasi di pantay sa balikat nung sinubukan ko lagi nabababa sa left side kala ko sa pagsuot lang nung hinubad ko chineck ko yun nga di pantay hmmm 
wtong item sent i ordered white vneck and they sent a gray one when i want to return the product they replied but they will not honor the time then they will cancel the pick uptsk
i ordered white ajd i received grey im dis appointed
ang pangit po ng tahi
the item that was sent is male size i ordered ladies medium but the items arrived is for male so the sleeve is big and long compared to ladies size i am very disappointed as the white color shirt is my favorite and thats the only reason i ordered it because i needed it
attention po seller bakit naman pinadala mo ang tshirt na damage po mahirap po kumita ng pera and binayad po namin ay panaghirapan at wala pong damage ang pera namin na binayad sa inyo ayusin nyo po ang service nyo bago nyo ipadala ang product na i inorder sa inyo i need a replacement nito kasi isauli ko po ito sa inyo dahil hindi ko maisout yan dahil malaki ang butaspoor service
disappointed wala ang aqua bluedisappointedsecond purchased my problem na sa item deliverychat informed the seller but apparently you dont have choice for any refund or send u the item which was not on the parcel but a voucher to wait for about days approval but when u purchase almost days there the item was delivered but with missed itemu paid what u should paid for the item that u ordered disappointed really hope for better packing correct items
maganda ang tela kso may neddle hole sya s sleeve
super disappointed magkakaiba ang sizes ng xl na pinadala dont reply as if i didnt message you right away i did but you only rationalized not even addressed my complaint according sa organics for the size difference there are times that there will be over sizes under sizes kahit anong responsable mong mamimili talo ka tell me organics anong size ba dapat ang pinili ko kung ganito kalaki ang discrepancy ng sizes ng xl nyo ireturn na lang yan ang reply nyo
luma na yung binigay niyo saken
i wouldnt recommend the store i approached them first before posting my review unfortunately a discount voucher is the only thing they can offer not a replacement for a damaged item they will sent you definitely they would advise not to return the product what else they could do with it what am i supposed to do with it di ko rin naman masusuot i ordered five all small but the sizes also varies
aside from not the same size just look at the picture it explains a thousand words
 order ko gray cobalt blue at aqua blue ang dmting skin same color so dissapointed
i ordered shirts xl size pero iba iba ang size ng dumating though lahat tagged as xl 
wrong size delivered baiqjbwgehwjksksmansbixjsbwhsjndbdjdndbdjjdndjdidjeoskdndjhxns
bakit po ganito tahimaluwag ang mga tahipag laba makakalas na
i received different items from what i ordered i got round neck shirts of different colors instead of getting v neck shirts of blue and yellow
hay nako nakakadismaya po excited pa na man ako sa order ko yon pala may butas ang damitayusin mo naman seller nagbayad ako ng maayos tapos ganito lang pala matanggap kosana po binusisi ng maayos ang product bago pinackor baka yong pinadala nyo sa akin eh yong hindi natanggap sa qcsayang flagship store pa naman kayoat buti na lang isa muna yong inorder ko
out of tshirt were damaged
xl po order ko sa red small ang pinadala nyo sobrang hassle mag return

incorrect item delivered i ordered for vneck shirt but i got the round neck shirt plus mas mahal tong item na to compared sa inorder ko sana next time idouble check nyo bago nyo iship

isang seller naman ang paladesisyon
akala ko makapal yung tela manipis pala kaya mahal sya sa presyong php di ko pa natry isuot kung mainit o komportable ba sa balat anyway stars lang sa item very good ang delivery mabilis
when i saw the product i thought it was stretchable its not and also theres a hole between the legs you can see the pic and video below but the size i ordered is exactly what i want shipping and handling theres no problem
maganda yung item but the problem is wrong size yung short na pinadeliver it should be size of and size of but they gave same size of hustle kung ibabalik pa maybe next time double check before ipadeliver 
okay nman sna ung item kaso different color ung dumating sken nag message pa aq kay seller na sna tamang color mareceived ko kc base sa mga complaint na nababasa ko madalas about sa color kaso ganun pa din wrong color pa din pinadala nya sna nman seller mging honest nman po kau sa color na pinapadala ninyo sa mga customer ninyo or qng hnd nman po available ung color at least inform ur customer first before ninyo palitan ung color un lng nman
maganda po sana kaya lang wrong size i ordered pero ang dumating sobrang sikip sa magsusuot sana kahit ibang color nlng basta size so stars lang
good quality mali lang yung color n binigay i ordered grey but white grey yung dumating
wrong size dlvr
refund one damaged 
mabilis matastas ang tahi
manipis ang tela pero sakto lng s price
magkaiba sila ng kulay
manipis po yung tela
manipis lng
manipis lng
maganda sana manipis lang
i disappointed the color it looks old
manipis 
not actually as expected
malinaw poh sa order ko n dark green bkit poh gray ang dumating hindi manlng poh kayo nagmessage n hindi available ang dark green pero dahil andito n at no choice ok n rin hndi n nmin ibabalik kahit hindi nmin gusto ung color 
not totally waterproof as seen in the video because its absorb water
looks nice pero isang laba palang napunit n agad
not waterproof tumatagos din ang liquid
medyo manipis pala ung gitna
ndi tama ung color ng order ko
manipis lng po ang quality nya
ang size ay maliit sa actual na sukat
it slips a lot
thin
may butas po
kentucky order ko pero hindi kentuky dumating tapos meduim size small binigay nyo
hehenaexcite pa naman akong buksan taz sira pala un itemnagchat aq sa seller voucher worth pesos lng ang kaya nilang ibigayhahaeh di wow inyo na p nyo
hindi man lang nag double check if may sira ang item nakakadisappoint kasi butas yung sa may sleeve underarm
wrong item sent they do not know the difference between round vs v neckthen when you return the product they dont know how to honor it they will cancel the return so you have no choice but to bear with the wrong itemtsk
maganda ang tela kaya lang hindi accurate ang sukat nila xl inorder ko puro xl nga ang dumating magkakaiba nman ng laki
bad experience we requested to return the items we ordered from organic they approved of the return and so we sent the items to lbc with the return number only to find that our return request has been cancelled i wonder how did that happen so ngayon wala na yung item sa amin tapos di pa naibalik yung ibinayad namin we never experience this to other shirt shops only here in organic balik tuloy ako sa crown shirt wherein okay na okay ang crown sa aftersalecustomer service sayang yung ibinayad namin ibalik niyo yung ibinayad namin please lang never again to this seller bad aftersale service 
please pa update namn items ang binayaran qoh items lang ang pinadala since july pa aqo nagsabi ng concern ung selller laging i will check ang reply araw araw 
this was not included in the first parcel so i followed it up but unfortunately in the nd parcel the seller sent me a mens underwear instead of white shirt the items is good quality but the processing of the order wasnt good
color was not followed
im a cotton user and im sure that this is not cotton as you mentioned sana wag nlng po maglagay ng organic kng hnd nman at ang tahi sobrang hnd maayos not recommended 
hindi maganda ang tela sakto sa presyo nya mainit din naman ang tshirt pambahay
wrong size sa isang tshit ung pinadala siguro kasi out of stock na ung size na inorder ko pero nagsabi man lang 
panget e
pang girl order ko pero pan lalaki dumatinganlaki tuloy pakicheck naman po
sana kung wala ng stock ang vneck wag na sabihin last stock na may available pa sabi ko na round neck ang marereceive ko kasi matagal na naubusan ng vneck maging honest n lang sana tayo if out of stock na talaga at sobra tagal ipaship hindi ko alam if oorder pa ako ng large size kasi baka round neck n naman ipadala v neck tlaga ang gusto ko tsk tsk
poor quality
kelan pa naging round neck ang vneck at kelan pa naging medium ang large kung wala kayo available na item sabihin nyo nag select pa ako ng order kung kayo din pala masusunod 
i ordered items i only receive nakakadisappoint
very poor items pa nmn order ko 
tatlo order ko white yellow prehas lahat ng size na xl pero yung yellow na order ko maliit large lang binigay nakakainis diko man magagamit nakakadala umorder sainu
white ang order ko pinadala nyo gray marunong ba kayo magbasaang layo naman ng white sa gray
mali ung dumating
ang order ko v neck pero lahat ng diniliver saken lahat round neck at ang order ko xl pero large ang dumating matagal na tpos mali pa
nagttaka lang ako bakit wla packaged yung white ko order yung dalawa shirt na black nakapackaged naman prang sinuksuk lang bigla e nakkasad
ok sana makapal kaso madumi iba pa pagkaputi sa kong order yung order ko di nakabalot kaso mas maputi eto nakabalot pero may mantsa tapos parang luma pagkaputi buti lang inorder ko muna balak ko sana yung by s
may damage ang nipis pa ng tela di sya tlga xlarge
liit ng sizeslarge na nga inorder ko medyo fit n sa akinbuti n lang strechable yung tela
mali ung order n dumatingvneck order q round ung dumatingska may mga mantsa halatang old stock
may small yellow stain ung sa neck parang ndi xa dumaan sa quality contro at hindi xa naka packed tulad nung gray shirt kong order
kaya siguro mura kasi di pantay sa balikat nung sinubukan ko lagi nabababa sa left side kala ko sa pagsuot lang nung hinubad ko chineck ko yun nga di pantay hmmm 
disappointed i ordered for vneck shirt they shipped round neck 
items are mistakenly packed i ordered pcs cotton vneck white ladies large size but i received mens large sizes so much disappointed 
wrong color receivednot v neck too
quality fabric is okay worksmanship is nah
may sira sya sayang dahil totoong cotton nmn
nice t shirt pero walang quality control kasi may stain ung t shirt
yung nauna kong inorder complete and true to sizes pero yung next order ko same size pinadala pero di na nasunod yung sizing maliit na yung isa
items are good quality but item handling services are very poor missing items incorrect color and sizes item return not allowed store is not ready for bulk orders it would appease if the refund was converted to wallet but voucher for your store just made it more disappointing sa hassle na napagdaanan ko for sure di na ulit ako bibili sa inyo im so sorry i have to give this stars only
too small medium yata to for kids 
i ordered red and blue both large size but in actual they are not same size and tagged large size on shirt both
material too thick and not suitable for warm weather
their size small is way smaller than other brands jockey bench etc the stitches arent as good also well maybe because its cheaper
maliit yung sizes di kasya sakin
sabi ko xl mali ang nadeliver large ang binigay
ito yung part ng order ko na may butas yung tshirt sa likod
xl is too small
manipis masyado
maganda yung shiet pero yung packaging hindi maganda nadumihan na yung damit kasi naka pack
ordered for medium but their sizes were very small ordered items such a waste of money
i ordered one size bigger than my usual shirt size but still too small for me
not pack well and slightly dirty
i am medium to large frame so i ordered large to make sure pero di parin kasya the fabric is not stretchy and the stitches is poor quality
not packed po i dont know why sana po inayos pag pack kasi iisipin po ng buyer na used item na po
manipis kita yung bra
unsatisfied 
maganda tela pero di pantay ang tahi ng v sa harap 
hnd n sya klad ng yna q g inorder tas wla png plastic bwat isa tinipid tlga
okay naman yung tela kaso sa delivery nagkaproblema ang order ko pcs pero pcs lang dumating tapos isang item lang ang may packaging
maliit lang pala sya di kaya yung laptop ko pero oks na wala naman na ako magagawa haha
different item received from the posted picture walang rubber ung paanan ng table sa bed ko pa nman gagamitin so dumudulas sya hndi din ergonomic yung pinakatable as shown in their post straight ung pinadala saakin walang curve
good sana sya kaso may dame sa bandang lagayan cup
damged we thought request for change item was denied bec took time to respond too late my kids already used it kahit may damage next time package it with carton since were paying nmn ng delivery fee same with the delivery service they should carefully tranpost the package with extra care
faulty and some defects but oh well guess its because the price is cheaper than the usual 
bkt wlng rubber ang mga paa ng table nuga pag n tyoat nd secured ang pgk blotgas n 
maliit lang sya kinda right from the price pambata lang tlga sya at hindi pwede s malalakimg laptop

medyo may scratch sya sa board pati sa legs tapos walang goma sa pinaka legs nya unlike sa photo
item is well packed but quality not so goodng cracked ksi masikipnot fitfast delivery considering the enhanced quarantine
the item was damaged it was not packed well walang box and manipis lang yung pagka bubble wrap knowing sa provincial address e dedeliver yung item
its not steady ots moving

wala yung non slip niya ngay pero okey nmn siya kaya lang natutumba tumba dahil don
great in terms of packaging and shipping problem lang sa item is curved ung corners ng paastand so madaling matumba
not really as the same as what on the picture but it is ok looks durable though size is also ok
thanks parin seller nakuha q xa s murang halaga pero d maaus ang packaging only bubble wrap kaya nag cause ng dent s mga sides o sinadya nyo tlg un kaya mura lng c item kc defective nginawan q nlng ng paraaan
cant say its good and cant say its very bad neutral
the item is good however the gadget holder does not fit in the hole
am not happy with itno rubber sa stand nya
pang kids size siya d ko inexpect na ganon kaliit but ok lahat size lang nung item problem ko
very nice only small scratches xp but it was as expected in the picture it shakes a little so its not the best but still its a table
okay sana niregalo ko pa naman sa baby brother ko for his school works sira nung inopen namin kanina 
so far maayos nman yung item hindi lng totally yung nasa picture thanks anyway
almost the same but not the one as advertised or in the picture not a good one only fit for the price but not as useful as the item is very un steady
ok nmn sya kulng lng sa stop sa base
medyo mabilis masira pero mura kasi ganon talaga
table is damage
wasnt able to take a photo cause i bought it to my dorm may mga gasgas na yung stand idk old stock na siguro
ok namn ung table kaso lang basag lagayan ng tubig at my minimal na scratch
medyo okay na thhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnkkkkkkkkk yyyyoiiuuuuuu
ang cute ng size nagustuhan din naman ng kids ko pwede n din gamitin late review now lng sinipag
maganda sya kaso may mga stain at damage
am expecting same as in picture with rubberized on stand somehow not dont expect to much if we based on price i bought it twice same as in wishing not however enough is enough no need to expect to much 
walang rubber ung paa kulang diniliver nyo
okey sana kaso my mga sira na at crack sa gilid sa pag ship siguro dikasi binalot ng husto para dimasira
maliit lang sya sa isang binti kasya hahhaa kasura disappointed ang umorder ung sa baba ung order ko dito sa shop nato ung asa taas sa picture order ng anak ko sa iba na shop
cute kaso walang rubber na black sa paanan hindi maka tayo ng maayos
really a mini desk not recommended if youre using a wide laptop not as illustrated no rubber around the stand
wala yung rubber na angsusupport don sa stand para hindi dumulas the yung lagayan ng pen natatagal
cheap
naku ang liit pala niya di katulad ng sa iba
disappointed may damage yung gilid nya 
the package was delivered faster that its estimated delivery date however the item has a crack on the cup holder it was only wrap with bubble wrap it was mark as fragile but still came broken
daming damage nung dumating nakakaumay e sayang pera
may damage sa gilid gilid di mabuting pag package atbpag handle sa package will not buy again
hindi manlang mag response ang seller sa ganitong case gusto ko i return at mag refund dahil andaming damage saka yung plastic na balot wala namang punit ibig sabihin bago pa ibalot ganyan na sana ayusin niyo yes maaring kumita ka sa maliit na halaga pero di kana uli bibilihan kaya sayo parin ang balik niyan seller chat ako ng chat di ka man lang mag response sayo na yang maliit na halaga well di lang naman ako yung nakaranas ng ganito
super pangit scam damage ang items pano ba naman dapat kasi sana nka bubble wrap plinastick lang ni seller sayang pera kasi sira dont buy here
kulang ung pinadalang item my dalawang accessories ang wala pano gagawin dto hindi kona din pwede i return kc na click kona ung recieve order
walang napakinabangan sa inorder ko sa shop nato sobrang hassle ndin i return 
to seller for a fragile items you should pack it properly to avoid defection how can i used the item if it is broken
grabe nmn ito seller nbagsak sya kpg nilagyan na ng tablet nd pantay ung paa
defective ung item may durogbasag na part sa corner kahit maayos naman ung balot nya ibig sabihin hindi sya gawa ng courier which means durogbasag na talaga sya nung pinadala may mga durog na part na nga sa loob ng plastic pagbukas ko yung isang item naman black pinadala kahit white order ko buti nalang na return refund hassle umorder sa seller na to sana turuan ng leksyon to ng lazada
wala manlang balot tsaka bubble wrap lang nung binili ko pano pag masira un masasayang pa ket mura lang
super dislikeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee supperrrrr dislikeeee 
ano ga ho are ang mahal ng bayad ko tas sira pa yung item ko kay tagal ko inantay sana na bago ninyo ideliver pakitignan ng ayus kakasura wag na kayo bumili dine madidismaya lang kayo
 yung foldable laptop na inorder ko lang dumating please contact me 
the product has damages on it
i was of the impression that it is big sturdy but i was wrong like my previous laptop table
wala syang rubber sa paa dapat meron sya tulad ng nasa image sana wag nyong gawin to sa iba kala kk naman good sya un pala hindi
my damage plus ndi tama ung length na nasa description cm lng ndi cm
may damage po nkaka disappointed
ang tagal mo intay tapos ito lang dadating sayo
unfortunately i received a bad item
ok n sana magandakaso may crack sya cguro sa delivery n ito pinaghahagis lngkahit may bubble wrap ayun may damage parin ewan q kung sa seller or dun n sa pag deliver 
anliit pala niya ang may damage pa dumating sakin
it was sturdy it was heavy as it was needed to be steady good quality however i received it with damage there were two cracks
im not happy with my order i ordered pink they delivered black with defects kudos to the kind delivery man though wala din ung rubber sa paa nya so natutumba
honestly speaking the item is not worth it because the design is different from what ive ordered and also the quality is poor
may sira sira na ung gilid tapos di pantay pantay ang screw ng paa sa baba mura pero talagang di quality
dahil sa prize nya n mura asahan nyo n may mga gasgas at tuklap nn pintura
i recommend to choose cash on delivery because they will insist to send you the wrong color i am very dissappointed on what they did wrong color of product delivered poor customer service not responsive on queries good packaging and good delivery service so star for overall review
disappointing expectation vs reality received a small version of the table witch i did not order not ordering again 
damaged item
incomplete and damaged delivery may gas gas siya tyaka napansin ko di siya pantay
nakaka disappointed ksi order ko blue dumating pink ih sana ngsabi si seller hindi amn lalaki ksi anak ko pink papagamit ko tsk next time sana seller sbhin na lang kong hindi available 
iba ung nasa picture walang rubber mabilis tumaob ung mesa mabagal mag teply c seller stars
poor packaging basag ung table pagdating sa akon
its damaged on one corner and the picture had rubber black cornering looked bigger with an arching length side but this one doesnt have the rubber on legs and its just plain flat rectangle on both length
i really dont like so disappointed about this item i thought medio malaki sya pero i was wrong ang liit nya at kasya sya sa aking yrs old na kapatid not only sa size but may damaged din sya hayst 
disappointed ako sa damage ay can be seen sa pictures attached i dont know kung sino may kasalanan ung seller ba or carrier
not the same in the picture i already have this laptop table same color pero wala syang rubber sa ilalim so pg nasa kama di stable so nung nakita ko sa picture meron syang rubber i bought it pero nung nareceive ko wala rubber so di ko sya magagamit since same lng nmn sya sa isang laptop table ko
i am disappointed how the products were handled i received dents on both of my tables even if they were wrapped in bubble wrap it seems they were not handled with care very disappointed maganda pa naman pero may dents please see here
basag ang cup holder at walang rubber ang stand
i received a defective product the item was not secured enough sellers should learn from every reviews theyre getting from their customers so the next time an order is placed they know what to do next this is so disappointing

maliit lang pala ang tableisang dangkal lang ang taas sellers sana ayusin nyo ang item na ipapadeliver nyowala na ngang box ang nipis pa ng bubble wrap nyobasah tuloy ang tablenagagamit naman kaya lang may sira at maliit
grabe naman po dito na nga ako umorder dahil maganda reviews tapos sobrang delay ang ship ng item sabi dun dapat jan naiship na tapos naiship nyo jan na tapos may tapyas pa sa gilid at sobrang maalikabok yung delivery driver napaka mysterious pati walang picture sa lazada tapos di manlang ako kinontact na andyan na pala yung parcel naistorbo ko pa mga tao dito sa amin ayoko na tuloy umorder ulit sa store nyo baka sira naman next time
cracked yung likod tapos kinakalawang pa yung gilid sa mga bibili naka bubble wrap lng siya
actually gusto ko yung item but when i checked for the nd time damaged pala sya i try to chat the seller kaso ang hirap ma contact
nahuhulog laptop ko umuuga wla naman yung color black na nasa picture sayang lang pera tsk
one of the item i brought has been damaged due to not properly packed so disappointing i expected to have a good packaging kasi tables inorder ko sa shop na to but sadly yung bubbles lang naka balot tapos nag punit punit pa yong plastic na naka cover sa table goshhhhhhh i thought the seller has the idea to cover it properly but not tskkk not recommended this
mura nga pero di ko naman magamit sa sobrang liit pang ipad lang ito pag laptop wala na lugar sa mouse
sira waste of money but that doesnt mean im recommending you not to buy this i hope you can read this seller
nice but the other table has lacking parts as what you have seen in the pictures so disappointed
mali ung kulay n binigay pink ang binigay black ang order ko pero cge ok na to katamad mg sole
sobra liit akala ko medyo malaki tapos may sira p ang gilig
may damage eh chip and dents not sure kung sa handling ba pero securely bubble wrapped naman kaya sa tingin ko hindi ito nacheck ng seller ng maigi bago ipack 
may warat ung table sa ilalim 
very disappointed 
elegant and durable i like the color and style too highly recommend to all who are looking for small but affordable study table satisfied costumer here
the product was damaged i hope that rider or seller will make sure that the product or parcel was delivered in a good condition

bought this item a month ago however i only opened it today since i was really busy and i had my bigger desk to use now that we opened it the table has a crack on it and its seen on the pictures attached i paid the exact amount and i dont think its the couriers fault since the damage is within the plastic and upon the item today it was sealed with a bubble wrap i need a refund for this

i ordered white pero black ang dumating i even message the seller before niya iship pasend muna ng picture ng item pero naka auto message ata sila ang dami pang gasgas ng item 
wrong delivery i ordered for cm x cm but what i received is cmx cm very wrong very very wrong
wrong color and wrong dimension naibigay ang order ko black ang naideliver is brown ano pang purpose nung choices kung hindi din naman pala masusunod yung inorder i even messaged the store kung ano kulay ung gusto ko at naglike sya tapos ganito yung idedeliver pakipalitan nalang please
the legs are quite smallshort for its platform im disappointed since i was expecting the legs would fit end to endcorner to corner to the size of the table the table has its tendency to flip because of that i like the design of the table though looks like a slab giving it stars
d man lng inayos ng seller ang packaging sana nilagyan ng box or pantapal sa mga kantosulok damaged tuloy ung edge nung dumating skin d ko n bnalik hassle pa sa shipping tsk star lang for this beware sa mga bibili honest review lang
wrong size wrong color packer dw ang nag papack malamang pero as a seller hindi mo ba chinecheck o baka sadyang trip mong mangago pwes nagkamali kalakas mo manloko
damage item double check muna sanapara d na kailngan magreturnrefund
maganda yung item pero mali ung size na dumating nanay ko kc ung kumuna kc nasa work ako ang alam lmg nila mesa lang sana magawan agad ng action ni seller tuloy nakakapag duda mag order x ung order ko x dumating
akala ko white ung stand kase sa pic all white tapos nakahiwalay ung stand wala man lang instructions pano ikabit for a person like me im not a handyman so pano ikakabit to may mga gas gas pa tas nilagyan ng tape ung top ng table hindi matanggal ung dikit ano ba yan sobrang fail ng bili na to
minessage ko pa si seller na white ipadala na right color and dimension instead of white brown pinadala nakakainis nagbabayad naman ako ng tama
con wrong color size hassle to return pro quick delivery low shipping cost
maling kulay ung binigay abala nakakatamad mag sauli so star kamoteng seller
wrong size dapat x double check before you ship
i ordered the wood design pero iba yung dumating akala ko malinaw na yung usapan namin sa chat before i placed the order

basag sayang ang pera wala kc bubble wrap porki mura d mappakinabangan
none of the colours were given correctly i ordered diff colours except white but i received all white colours
wrong color given i contacted lazada and they gave me credits instead due to wrong color i specified the right color since it was displayed online peru iba binigay so i decided to keep the item and not to return it seller just apologize for the inconvenience too bad
l ordered color green and blue i received color gray why is that wrong color delivered please the ordered if no color available notify us
i ordered black and green but what i got is color white

la chaussure puma suede classic est troue au bout de quelques jours dutilisation normale le tissus trs mince sur le dessus de la chaussure sest dchir je regrette cet achat
this product isnt true fit like the description says theyre way too big and large for the regular clarks size chart i used to buy my husband brought a w pair wich is his regular size in this particular shoe brand and they were way too big like bigger size then i decided to order the shoes again in a smaller size w cause he actually like this model so much and as you can see in the picture they were exactly the same size even that we i ordered it half size smaller im really disappointed cause my husband has tons of clarks shoes and this is the first time this happen maybe because i didnt buy the in the store if you are gonna buy them choose them smaller size

bought these for outdoor wear i have purchased nb shoes in the past with no problem but i sent these back the same day i received them i read the reviews re tendency to run small so i ordered a size larger length and instead of my usual e i ordered e waaaay to tight to the point it was ridiculous figured they gave me the wrong size nope right there on the label when person says theyre to tight thats one thing when a dozen people say it something is wrong nb should be ashamed
bought these because they are one of the few wide shoes made with good ankle support however the design is not a good one for men with wide feet the tongue of the shoe is sewn to the sides making it difficult to put the shoe on and uncomfortable across the top of the foot it also is very narrow i measured the sole of a size e against a pair of new balance size d shoes and the difference in width was negligible the insole they put inside is actually too wide for the shoe itselfjust really bad execution of a great idea
poorly manufactured we purchased for our grandson and after he wore them times the ankle area of the inner left boot ripped after he tripped over a branch so disappointed with this boot because we have other new balance shoes and encountered no problems i hope we can return because it says the return window is closed
ipurchased these primarily because of the new balance name i am greatly disappointed the soles of the boots have separated from the rest of the shoe and this happened within first months of almost daily use i can not believe how poorly manufactured these are especially with the new balance name
it is difficult to get my fee into them and when i do i feel like i have boats on
shoes are comfortable but they arent even months old and the design of the shoe is causing the material at the ankle to fatigue it bends every step i take disappointing
pens que eran originales y de piel como los de adulto y me salieron clonados y de piel sinttica
my kid burns through shoes pretty fast im now adding kswiss to the list of name brand shoes that just arent made like they used to be they survived about a month with medium wear do not recommend getting your year old shoes that have cloth loops for laces of them ripped out and now my kid cant tie them up had to drill holes in them to use for the laces and a decent pair of school shoes are now play shoes nice try kswiss you can go sit on the bench with the sketchers adidas guess we will stick with nike puma for awhile
avevo aspettative molto alte sul prodotto considerando le marca molto famosa nello sport ma ho dovuto ricredermi qualita della plastica da migliorare spero che riescano a resistere allo sport considerando un assemblaggio non troppo perfetto
it is very uncomfortable shoes i doubt its organelle or notinfact will write to puma to look into
i was so excited to find one if my fav shoes in stock since im pretty sure its been discontinued unfortunately they arrived used with some pretty gross looking unidentifiable crud on the bottom of the shoes i uploaded pics but they dont really pic up the texture my closest guesses to what was on the bottom is dried mud paper mache and spider webs the shoe packing that normally goes inside new shoes was missing too im so bummed i shouldve known it was too good to be true 
this shoe was way too large i have always ordered my running shoes a full size larger did the same with these shows but they were so large they looked like clown shoes sent them back immediately
if you have a high instep like many shoe companies now skechers skimps on velcro saving a fraction of a cent but making the shoes unwearable unless you have lowprofile feet yet at the same time theres way more velcro than would ever be needed on the heel strapthere are also prominent ridges across the sandals separating the toes from the rest of the foot as well as another ridge between the large toe and the remaining toes so unless you have perfectly average feet you may find those uncomfortablethe relaxed fit is a nice idea just poorly executed in lacking sufficient velcro
i am so disappointedthese shoes arent cheap for a year old and less than month into use we have pairs of shoes we rotate use of regularly in the same size the stitching at the toe has come undone and there is a big hole
i wrote an earlier review giving these shoes stars im changing that to im giving them a because they are comfortable as walking shoes the reason for the demotion is due to the mesh material they are subject to getting holes in them which is poor construction so my earlier praise is gone i was getting out of my car and bumped the door with my foot resulting in a small hole in the shoe at the toe nothing you can do to fix it so now water comes in and you can see your foot or sock if white i missed the return date by one day too much money to get holes in them you shouldnt go around being afraid of your shoe getting holes new balance should know better and so should i
shoe specified slip on construction maybe i am too literal but i thought this meant the shoe just slipped on and did not have laces to tie the picture made it look similar to other shoes that have the lace look but no actual shoe lace to tie this is not the case i am sure these are perfectly fine sneaker but not for someone who does not have the dexterity to ties a shoe

did not like that these shoes felt really hard in the arch area definitely not a fan
der stoff an der jacke lst sich leider schnell ab
i purchased these for the rocker sole to help with hallus rigidus swapped out the insole for my custom orthotic and tried them on they were quite snug i assumed my first mistake that they would stretch and wearing them around the house for a bit with the tags on they did seem to loosen so off came the tags and i wore them outunfortunately that tiny bit was all they stretched and they remained far too tight across the vamp in particular the liner crosses over the top of the foot under the elastic and forms a painful pressure point since i now had of unreturnable shoe i preformed shoe surgery and removed the stitching across the top in that section this let the liner stretch slightly but not enough even in my older thinner orthotics and trouser socks the pressure point remains when you wear them for any length of time i may yet perform more surgery to remove the liner from the toe area because they are unusable for me in their current fitclark shoes run a bit small and narrow in my experience so i ordered half a size up and regular instead of narrow width this portion fit as expected if you do not need to swap out the insoles and so not need lateral support these shoes might work for you the rocker sole does help with mild toe arthritis severe cases will want to look for a stiffer sole than thesetldr dont buy if you wear custom orthotics dont buy if you pronate dont believe they will stretch when you try them on
one of the eyelets came off the first time i laced the shoes there is a flaw in the design poor quality
the sole came detached after wearing these for days only
ja die schuhe passen sind aber nicht so schn wie andere kangaroos die ich besitzeziemlich klobiges design preis war aber okay sehr empfindliches obermaterial
just received these shoes today it was delivered earlier than usual i have small feet a size or so i ordered a size it was still tight so i am returning but what realllly bothered me was that its yellow on parts of the shoe dont like that at all looks dirty already
i was unable to get the shoes on they were so narrow althoughi had ordered in my regular sizei would not recommend this product
no se ve muy bien puesto es muy anchose ve mal
bad quality
zunchst vorneweg der schuh ist super passt wie erwartet und ist komfortabel und schick verarbeitungsqualitt lsst keine wnsche offen dh der schuh selbst verdient keine stern bewertung aber man kann nur das produkt bewerten und nicht das kauferlebnis selbst das ist ja grundstzlich bei amazon hervorragend und ich bezeichne mich selbst eher als amazonjunkie als amazonkunde aber was diesmal mit der primewardrobe bestellung passiert ist ist denke ich eine rezension wert denn das geht gar nicht wei nicht so recht wo der fehler ist das muss amazon versuchen zu lsen folgendes ist passiert sehe den schuh zum sensationellen preis von eur bei zalando war er deutlich teurer und lege ihn in den warenkorb es wurde mir angeboten direkt zu dem preis zu kaufen oder in wardrobe zu dem preise zur anprobe denke mir nichts und lege ihn in wardrobe knnt ja sein dass er nicht passt also nutze ich doch den komfortablen zurprobe bestellweg schwups bestellt und bekomme per mail die besttigung aber ohne preis eur wurde abgebucht steht da nur in der besttigung denke mir nichts denn habe ja fr eur in den warenkorb gelegt also wird es schon passen drcke nochmal auf den artikel und sehe preis liegt jetzt bei eur ok denke ich da habe ich ja nochmals glck gehabt und einen richtig guten preis bekommen denkste heute schuh bekommen passt perfekt also gleich ins amazonkonto und schuh behalten drcken aber was steht da schuh fr eur kaufen oder zurckschicken hmm aber ich habe doch fr eur in den warenkorb gelegt und bestellt aber nirgends ist ein beweis dafr zu finden im kundenkonto steht eur und in der besttigungsmail kein preis habe das doch nicht getrumt also kundenservice angerufen aber nichts zu machen ich kann gerne zurckschicken die eur ist der preis ok das war kein besonders gutes kauferlebnis muss ich jetzt die preise abfotografieren nach der bestellung na egal habe den schuh trotzdem bezahlt er war auch mit eur sehr gnstig aber hnlich zalando eur was aber gar nicht entscheidend ist wegen ein paar eur mehr oder weniger aber sehr unbefriedigend ist schon das man artikel zu einem bestimmten preis in den warenkorb legt und dann offensichtlich ohne es zu merken oder den preis besttigt zu bekommen zu einem anderen preis bestellt bzw dann den kauf abschlieen muss das geht so nicht habe definitiv beim abschicken der bestellung knopf jetzt bestellen den preis von eur angezeigt bekommen und erwarte dann auch dass ich zu dem preis kaufe und kein anderer auch wenn preise im hintergrund schwanken aus meiner sicht ein fehler im system und fr mich ein grund wardrobe nicht zu nutzen also vorsicht beim bestellen ber wardrobe keine ahnung ob ich ein einzelfall bin oder andere auch schon diese erfahrung gemacht haben definitiv muss amazon aber hier am system nachbessern
no es la primera vez que compro zapatos de esta marca pero estos llegaron en una caja distinta no de la marca una caja de amazon y sucio uno de los tenis como que usaron o veces se notaba que pisaron con el
es sind schne schuhe die auch sehr wertig aussehen und sich nach dem eintragen gut anfhlenleider ist vor kurzem eine naht geplatzt und damit auch gleich der schuh offenkeine zustzliche verleimung etc sondern die einfach genhte ziernaht ist an dieser stelle alles was den schuh zusammenhltsie sehen wertig aus ohne wirklich substanz dahinter zu haben ich werde mich wohl nach einem schuh made in eu umschauen
die fe schwitzen darin luft undurchlssig keine empfehlung
disappointed that the shoe didnt fit
i ordered this in tan to replace a shoe i ordered in a size the size shoe was tan this shoe from this seller in a is brown there is a distinct color difference did not bother to send back these shoes run about half a size too big waste of money for me this time
the shipping was very bad the shoes box was ruined completely
did not fit
everyone is being nice and saying these run small haha but i just ordered a size and it doesnt even fit my sister who usually wears a same story with the other pair of shoes i bought from this brand this isnt just running small this is inaccurate sizing shoes arent like clothes i know i have to be careful when i order pants or shirts because sizes can vary but in every other store on the planet earth i wear a size us this is just inexcusable honestly instead of expecting shoppers to order one size up how about you just measure the actual shoes and send them the right size
i admit i bought these shoes because they look so cool and ive always loved reeboks comfort and when i first put them on i loved them but after walking around the house for an hour or so they felt so tight the fabric really didnt stretch even as much as leather might i bought an which is size larger than i normally buy so i didnt feel comfortable moving to a it wasnt the length that was the problem they were just too inflexible sadly i sent them back
they are very comfortable and fit as expected for use around the house they are ok these are not for cross training the material is like neoprene and when working out or walking outside on slanted ground your foot slides all over
been wearing ours for less than a month and during virtual learning and they are a mess we dont really go places very often and they are wrecked
i know my yo plays hard but i expect the shoes to last more than two months the front piece is almost dangling off and under that it looks like the mesh will rip i like the fit of the adidas but i think we are going back to nike for durability
picture shows good but in reality it looks ok and does not looks appealing i would skip this

boots have an awful odorat i take out from a plastic bag and they stayed all day out for aeration and nothing helped that awful odorat of chemical plastic is everywhere at the house unfortunately they will go backthe boots are for a large foot
per ben due volte ho dovuto restituire larticolo ordinato il n ma arrivato il per la prima restituzione col cambio articolo ho parlato anche con unoperatrice amazon per essere sicuro mi venisse sostituito con la taglia giusta ma nulla da fare la sostituzione stata fatta sempre con taglia errata
desastre total no tienen ni dos meses y apenas los he usado y ya estn despegados o rotos por el taln
ordinato ricevuto pero lo stile colore e qualit sono top per questo due e non solo una stella
las zapatillas son muy bonitas pero es la segunda vez que intento comprarlas y se equivocan con la talla
i got a size and had to send them back couldnt even get my foot in them overall theyre a cute shoe but wont work for me
really wanted to love these shoes initially very comfortable after three weeks of daily wear on vacation body of shoe has stretched at least a full size with only walking discovered after a light drizzle that soles have zero grip
no me han gustado a los dos meses de uso estn rotas por la puntera y solo las uso para correr y hacer deporte mximo dos horas al da psima calidad ni volver a comprarlas
i got these to replace my gel excite s after the quiz on the asics website told me these would be my best fit i wanted something with more cushion than my last pair but theres nothing soft about these soles at all its like running barefoot on pavement and the heel is so narrow when i run my heel goes over the sole and pinches between the sole and the shoe wall giving me blisters on the bottom of my heels ive tried a few runs and they dont get better my knees and ankle hurt within the first mile due to lack of support i can feel the shock in my heels with every strike i wish i could return these please dont waste your money on these
these look and feel fake glue everywhere another thing the insoles look as if it comes from a ten dollar made in china sneaker from a bargain store there is no name on it anywhere i remember reeboks having a name on the insoledefinitely feels and looks cheap i bought these for home because i have plantar fasciitis and they even suck at home on hardwood floors outside they feel even worst oh and these things have grip lol the rubber slips as if its plastic waste of money
love the colors and the height of the shoe the arch support is better than average i went a half size up from my normal size and they were on the large side after wearing them for an hour around the house the ball of my foot hurt terribly had to return them based on this experience i would steer clear of reebock brand
duraron como un mes o dos y luego se separ la suela del tenis sin ningn esfuerzo
the media could not be loaded prodotto e arrivato usatoin discrizione era scritto nuovonon e possibile non posso restituire
lo devolv por demasiado grande y an no han reembolsado el dinero
the stitching came apart after time wearing it
these shoes were much too large
after reading many reviews i decided to just do what the manufacturer suggested i measured my daughters foot which heel to toe was exactly inches based on the manufacturers own guide i ordered an for her in my gut i knew this had to be wrong as she usually wears or max but based on their own guidelines i went for it they were huge huge and hideous i wear a and they were huge on me she needed them asap so i hop on and order a size thinking an entire size down would be better wrong again the were better but still and entire size too big for her at this point i gave up took her to our local dance store and ponied up the extra they cost there vs these they fit great and are much more attractive i would not recommend these not worth my time and now i have to send these monsters back lol
the cleats break and this is the second that it has done it in
der schuh kam leider defekt an die sohle lst sich an der seite vom schuh
back of heel cup is soft and does not rebound after being stepped onto as the older nb slipon did it was solid im hoping they bring back the old model which was built like my nb running shoe outstanding
these shoes are beautiful and i do mean beautiful they are also well made and the leather is supreme however they wear horribly they wear very hot and the shoes are extremely heavy within a week of wearing them i also developed plantar fasciitis
the shoes are so comfy and i get a lot of compliments on these however these have zero suede the shoes are more of a final with a cushioned and comfortable lining even the box says suede but there is no suede or leather on these ahoes
perd talla cm y me mandaron cm lastima porque si estn bonitos 
i was so excited to received these because they looked so cool and flashy but immediately after i tried them on they were super uncomfortable the crease just above the top of the laces cut into my toes when i would bend my feet to take a step i was surprised because the reviews claimed to be comfortable and did not need any breaking in i must have got a bad pair i returned them for a different brand entirely
the back material and the front material inside the shoe isnt sewn together it looks like to me it should be a plastic like material is showing bn wont answer phone sent text and pics their website site said to do no response i guess i need to send back cant find out if it is a defect poor workmanship even if it is suppose to be like this i got the extra wide and it still feels a little tight the shoe strings are too short i had another pair of nb shoes in pass that the string whee too short i have to take the strings out of some of the whole to be able to have them loose enough to tie that pair was from years ago thought they would know by now to make their strings longer i have a high arch i dont know if that is the reason i need more string length but this is the only manufacturer that i have run into this problem if i but a pair of the mens i dont have that problem just some of their women tennis shoes i cant keep waiting for them to respond to tell me if this is a defect to send them back does anyone else that bought this show have the material inside the shoe look like this where the front material and the back material in the inside isnt sewn together please someone let me know since i cant get a response from nb
the shoe does not look quite like the picture it is over sized and i believe that daffy duck was the foot model unfortunately past the window to returnthese look like a knockoff
this shoe runs big i went out of the country and missed my return date now im stuck with an oversized brand new pair of shoes and most likely not going to get what i spent on it the shoe itself arrived ok it seemed like it can get damaged or bent super easily either way not happy with the sizing difference not even a little big its just too much
this is so fake its ridiculous do not buy the tongue is a thin foam sheet with the adidas logo printed on it not stitched its horrible and ugly and the sides have weird stitching just a horrible product im surprised this came from amazon disappointed 
they were embarrassingly squeaky they felt like they were made of cardboardespecially the tongue of the shoe i returned them
basket achet le septembre de mauvaise qualitje me suis dis que ctait lvis alors que a serait quand mme solide non la preuve a peine un mois aprs dj dcoll et un trou dans la chaussurecet article est fait en chine ce nest pas tonnantje ne recommande pasle prix tait pas trs chermais ce nest pas une raisondu de cette achat
bottom tread is gone in months wont buy spenco again
they were not comfortable they buckled up when i flexed by foot and was painful these are wide so maybe that is whyit did have a nice solid sole that i think would have kept me front getting bruises on the bottom of my feet but the part where it buckled up on the top was too much
el producto lleg en una talla que no era la solicitada eran para bebe en la descripcin del producto deca que eran de cm y llegaron de cm
extremely expensive especially due to it being sent from us
although these are cute and very lightweight as other posters have said they run small in my case i ordered a size up and they were still too small they also have a very narrow toebox which affects the fit as well the insole is definitely squishy however there is next to zero arch support this of course can be good for some people as can the narrow toebox these would be great for one of my daughters however they are not available in her size they do seem to be constructed well and feel sturdy although the sole is so light that it seems it would not hold up well over a few trail walks but i have to return these so i wont be able to find out for sure about that
i love the color the design and the fact that they are very light weight like some other reviews stated they do seem to run small especially in the toes i had even ordered them a half size larger than i usually wear
los devolv cuando llegaron vi que son brillosos estaba esperando algo negro liso
it runs small and ripped up my heel as the back is hard
at first glance i thought something was off with these black suede s but i was not quite sure what was amiss so i got out my favorite blue suede s for comparison see pictures the contours of the shoe were different from my blue pair of the sand upon closer inspection the insoles were also quite differentyou can see in the pictures my trusty blue suede s come with a more expensive removable insole the difference in quality is clear but only because i have an authentic pair from a reputable brick and mortar store to compare the convincing knockoff s to are the differences made apparentdont get me wrong i dont mind low cost replicas but i paid almost with taxes for these this could just be a oneoff or perhaps knockoffs are going undetected more than i imagined maybe the negative reviews for these shoes are actually for knockoffs and not the authentic nb productin any event i highly recommend you visit your local brick and mortar retailer call ahead and ask if they have the s in your size and request they order them in all the colors you are interested in trying thats how i ended up with the blue ones any local retailer still in business has to be doing something right and will be happy to order whatever you want
do not fit like other nb shoes they were very long they felt like clown shoes sent hem back they even tried to charge me shipping complained and they relented
didnt like fit or style
i dont think its a good quality
non confortevoli perch risultano essere pi piccole della taglia indicata
scarpe di bassa qualita
i got these usually have no problem with puma shoes but these are a little on a small side ordered a but feels like a i have blister under my ankle bone on both feet the tops of my toes hurt from wearing these
had to return them as they didnt fit and when i tried exchanging them they didnt have the colour in the size i needed great look though 
ich habe zwei jacken bestellt in farben limette und grn die farbe limette ist wie abgebildet dies ist geschmackssache was ich aber zu bemngeln habe ist der schnitt und vor allem die schlechte qualitt des stoffes ich habe die gleiche jacke in grn die ich schon vor ca jahren in einem store gekauft habe die ist mir superbegleitung beim regenwetter gewesen nur ist sie etwas in die jahre gekommen daher habe ich mir berlegt noch eine zu kaufen war aber sehr enttuscht die grne farbe ist etwas abgewandelt aber das ist nicht sehr dramatisch nur die alte jacke war aus einem sehr angenehmen und weichen wasserabweisenden stoff die jacken die ich hier bestellt habe sind hart und daher stehen sie ab und schmiegen nicht an krper ausserdem wurde offensichtlich der schnitt gendert die gre sitzt jetzt anders enger unbequemer auch des stoffes wegen und im brustbereich extrem eng auerdem fehlen an der jacke unter den achseln zwei ffnungen zur durchlftung sehr schade die jacken gehen sofort zurck
zunchst das positive das material fasst sich sehr gut an riecht nicht und hat keinerlei knitterfalten nach dem transport die farbe ist ein sattes melonenrot wirklich schn habe nummern grer bestellt und die gre passt perfekt sie ist hinten lnger und sieht wirklich gut aus sie hat tiefe taschen in die allerhand reinpasst als regenjacke kann ich sie aber berhaupt nicht empfehlen ich war min bei leichtem regen unterwegs und komplett nass an den unterarmen und vor allem an den schultern jeder windzug geht durch der futterstoff innen ist glatt und khl das ist unangenehm vor allem in den taschen nach dem tragen braucht die jacke ewig zum trocknen ich habe regenjacken fr des preises die funktionieren dies war ein fehlkauf und ist einfach nur eine bermig teure rote jacke schade
wir sind sehr enttuscht die stiefel x angehabt x nasse fe bekommen als mutter eines kleinen kindes bin ich sehr enttuscht schlielich kauft man gummistiefel damit die kinderfsse trocken bleiben und nicht umgekehrt es reicht aus wenn es drauen etwas frischer ist bei nassen fssen ist eine erkltung vorprogrammiert in der coronazeit sehr erfreulich wenn man die stiefeln betrachtet findet man keinen mangel der wird bei der berhrung der stiefel mit dem wasser gezeigt es war nicht einfach die kontaktdaten des verkufers zu finden ich wrde am liebsten sterne gebenupdate der verkufer ist toj skandinavian kids fashion vertrieben durch kktrade gmbh offensichtlich werden ber dieses angebot stiefeln verschiener verkufer vertrieben
i have bought this model times and now quality very disappointed the nose of the sneaker came off after couple wearing cant contact with customer service and solve this problem
on their way back ive always worn these and this pair was much narrower than i remember i question authenticity
diseo antiguo y calidad regular para el precio que tienen no me han gustado nada son ms feas y simples en mano que en la foto no las recomiendo eso s el tamao habitual encaja perfectamente
icvh habe schon einige schuhe von andrea conti und war immer sehr zufrieden dieser sneaker hat aber einen ganz anderen schnitt er ist vorne so eng da man berhaupt nicht hineinkommt auerdem fllt er viel kleiner aus
fatal pague envi rpido das y me tardo casi un mespor otro lado el producto bien original y todo eso
the sneakers smelled like plasticsynthetic not like authentic leather
la scarpa bella leggera cool ma purtroppo la taglia davvero indicativa i cm segnati sulletichetta sono in realt e oltre occhio alla misura
muy mala calidad puestas veces y ya estan como viejas
when i saw these sneakers i had to get them because i love the way they looked but it fit my son feet some what small which im not thrilled about that because on the website said it runs true to size i did not want to even bother sending it back so i just gave it to my nephew
these shoes looks super cute online but the toe part is long and makes them look weird on my sons feet but the bigger draw back is that on the inside of the heel is the bubble like cushion that sticks out like a inch he said it was very uncomfortable and rubbed on him
no es la talla correcta indica y en la caja de indica una pena
nachdem ich inzwischen bereits diverse turnschuhe der marke nike bestellt und anprobiert habe muss ich sagen dass es mich nicht wundert dass die hier vorliegenden nike fs lite run damen laufschuhe auch nicht passen denn anscheinend hat sich die generelle unsitte der zu kleinen turnschuhe eingebrgert was sehr rgerlich ist ich meine wenn man als frau schon gre bestellen muss obwohl man normalerweise schuhgren kleiner trgt und die dann auch nicht passen ich htte wahrscheinlich oder gebraucht das ist schon mehr als grenzwertig normal ist fr meine begriffe anders ich frage mich warum die turnschuhhersteller an ihren kunden vorbei produzieren das kann es doch nicht sein aber bei den anderen groen sportschuhanbietern ist es das gleiche trauerspiel dabei sind gerade in dieser und der letzten saison die modelle so farbenfroh wie nie und man wrde gerne sogar mehrere paare kaufen aber sie mssten natrlich passen das tun sie aber nicht entweder drcken sie vorne von oben auf den groen zeh herunter was schmerzt oder sie sind zu kurz und drcken schmerzen ebenfalls oder sie sind insgesamt am spann viel zu niedrig so dass man bei geschnrtem schuh immer noch eine super breite schnrlasche hat von weitem sieht das dann aus als htte man elefantenfe weil die schuhe zu wenig material haben um ganz geschlossen zu werden und das bei mir die ich superschlanke fe habe und jahrelang ballett getanzt habe einfach skandals me sollten die nike leute ihren produzenten mal neue schuhformen spendieren die hier scheinen noch aus einem anderen kulturkreis zu stammen in dem man puppenfchen hat aber nicht die fe einer groen westeuropischen frau
these suck i loved the look so i ordered a pair loved them and hadnt had them long at all then they came unstitched by the elastic i thought maybe i did something wrong so i ordered another pair and everything was going great and it just happened again yesterday not only am i so so disappointed bc they are apparently not good quality but these were the cutest and went with everything it makes me mad because i loved them so much
they are well made but the finger separator is too sturdy it hurts so much i cant wear them even if i put bandages all over my fingers i get a lot of blisters it is impossible to loosen this thing up especially during hot summers when the feet swell at this point they can only be a house decoration
no he encontrado ni una sola review de stas botas ni siquiera existen para el fabricante aunque el vendedor las describe como aptas para practicar el trail running no se debera practicar ningn tipo de ejercicio con ellas son inestables y el drop es demasiado alto perfectas para pasear aunque cuidado en verano el pi puede alcanzar la temperatura del sol no las recomiendo en absoluto he tenido que pagar gastos de envio para recibirlas ya que confi en la descripcin y es totalmente errnea ahora a pagar tambin para devolverlas tardaron tres semanas y adems el transportista se neg a subirlas a casa porque estaba muy alto toda una odisea no compro ms zapatillas en amazon mientras permitan la venta de stos productos sin control de calidad en este caso de falsedad una vergenza
estn muy bonitos pero me mandaron la talla equivocada se me hace injusto que esto pase en todos los pedidos ya que la mayora de los comentarios mencionaron este inconveniente pens que tendra suerte pero no fue as ped y me llegaron del los tendr que devolver 
they are by far the more uncomfortable shoes ever made for all terrain is correct but more of a outdoor rough hike or shore walk along a rugged beachi tried and struck out worn and cant return if looking for comfort run run far away use whatever is covering then toes not a bolt in the opposite direction now go
a pesar de ver los comentarios referentes a qu las tallas llegaban mal decid confiar y probar suerte y en efecto llegan mal las tallas no compren con estos vendedores es mi recomendacin el producto es bueno los humanos al seleccionar el nmero correcto son psimos al parecer
nice quality shoe but i have a couple problems with it that lead to a start rather than boa is using string instead of wire which it normally does and youre not able to get a proper tight fit second biggest issue is the fabric of the shoe lens it self to bunching up when you try to tighten it one of the biggest issues is the tongue of the shoe is too puffy so when the boa strings is trying to tighten it has to fight the puffiness which lends to a loose fit folks who love and use boa on their shoes will understand last major issue which is the shoe doesnt have enough arch support atleast imho on the plus side the sole of the shoe is one of the nicest ive seen but at this point ill probably stick with puma or footjoy
this is my third pair of adidas golf shoes i have bought in the past six months i play year round walk and carry my bag so fit and comfort is critical first two pairs are great so i expected the same with this pair received them on sunday and played in them on tuesday after holes my feet felt as if i was playing in leather soled dress shoes my heels are very low in the shoe and the ball of the feet feel bruised the support and comfort is completely different from my first two pairs of adidas i will need to add inserts to play in these again same price as the first two but comfort is not comparable
i ordered these in xxwide and the toe box is not very wide they are more wide in the middle of the shoe these must be intended for swollen feetankles not wide feet
the shoe was in the wrong box it was too small to return it i had to take it to the usps store which i could not get to so i have a pair of shoes for the trash last time i buy shoes from amazon
the back material is already ripped on both sandals they look like they are last years shoes
i bought these for my son for christmas along with another pair that he liked more he has only worn these times and it is already tearing at the toe tab 
my son had to have these the sole is cheap foamand the traction has completely worn off the bottoms are completely smooth now they have no laces so now theyve stretched out so bad they come off very easily i would not recommend i love addidas but for the price these are a fail 
poor quality tip of sneaker ripping apart not durable at all after only a month bought for my years old st grade girl my other kids sneakers didnt do this all at
very soft sole my year old wore the sole out in less than months
quality these do not seem like authentic adidas they have a very strange look in person i do not like them at all and nor does my childfit i wouldnt recommend ordering these but if you do make sure your kiddo has a narrow foot and order a half size up at least
i thought adidas would offer a quality material but my year old son already was able to wear it out the tip of the shoes within two months all he has been doing with the shoes is walking running biking playing in recess outside in school he does not play soccer so kicking or something like that is not the reason why the fronts torn out
looked great to start but after a few short weeks the front plastic toe started to crack open typical daily use would not recommend this product
the sandals were very cute extremely undersized my granddaughter wears a size and these wouldnt even go on her foot she doesnt have a wide foot so they should have at least went on width wise to me they looked more like a size i returned them i had bought them for a trip and there wasnt enough time to reorder
very narrow at the toes the beading was already curling up when we received it poorly sewn very low quality materials had to return themright away
when i saw the shoes i liked them because they would match a dress i bought for my daughter and i to have our family photos done when the shoes arrived i was immediately disappointed at how the shoe felt over all when i went to try them on my daughter she couldnt even slide her feet in because the straps at the front were too tight i even put lotion on her feet to see if they would slide in easier and thought she just needed to break them in my daughter started crying after having them on for less than minutes her feet had the strap marks imprinted on the tops of her feet for about minutes
my daughter is very petite and has little feet we ordered the sandals and they are super cute but the straps that go over the foot are ridiculously small my daughters foot wouldnt fit we exchanged for a larger size the same problem we have never run into this issue before with any shoes or sandals disappointed as they are so adorable
these look cute but the quality is terrible one of the straps broke after a month days after the return window my yr old is so disappointed dont waste your money or time on these
el envo tard menos de lo esperado pero la caja vena en una bolsa y la caja estaba en un mal estado los tenis no me quedaron bien por tener el empeine alto
i normally am a size so i went with a it is hard to buy shoes online without trying them on first so i gave it a go i took them out for a game last night they are very comfortable for turf however given the large size my touch was heavy and i couldnt connect with long passes getting under the ball my lesson learned try the size before you buy
runs huge returned three times for different sizes until the size was decent no support on footbed not impressed their market should stick to outdoors cleats of which adidas is king although the newer version of beloved outdoor clear nemesis is terrible on the ankle support please go back to the none of the travel soccer boys like the new version
these run really small my grandson wears a size toddler and size was tight and made his feet hurt
just the worst
this is a beautiful shoe the top of the shoe is extremely hard leather and cuts into the back of foot hard to wear or enjoy was bleeding after one day on both feet this is my second purchase of this shoe although love the style its a waste
i sent them back as they didnt fit
zunchst das positive das leder ist tatschlich angenehm weich das tragegefhl ist sehr angenehm weil der schuh eine weiche gepolsterte sohle hat das war es dann leider auch schon die verschweiung von sohle und leder lsst nach nur monaten deutlich nach feuchtigkeit und klte dringen ein die nieten fr die schnrsenkel sind so scharfkantig dass ich bereits mehrere paar schnrsenkel zerschlissen habe leider ein fehlkauf fr sollte die qualitthaltbarkeit um lngen besser sein
tremenda desilusin ya que al a menos de mes y medio ya se rompieron pens que la marca dara la calidad esperada
estn muy anchas pero adems hay una mas ancha que la otra y lo peor es que se me pas la fecha de devolucin
producto de mala calidad vena como roto lo sinttico de un costado de ambas sandalias si pueden no lo compren no vale la pena
the heel was uncomfortably tight just not the reebok shoe i remember
normally i love classics for my kids but this one was only worn for a week when the bottom fell off one week i was really disappointed
proottimo per consegna in anticipo di un giorno rispetto a quella previstamodello corretto taglia correttacontroil colore delle scarpe diverso da quello della fotola scarpa destra presenta rigature sulla pelle esterna ed interna come da foto e non aveva linserto per mantenere la forma sembra sia una scarpa espostanon richieder un reso ma ritengo decisamente preferibile meno solerzia nella consegna e pi correttezza nella coerenza con quanto esposto nella foto e nella qualit inoltre sullo store lumberjack il modello con il colore che mi arrivato venduto ad un prezzo inferiore

the first walk with these shoes the soles started to crumble off like maybe the rubber was not hardened or just too soft to be used on a shoe sole it was minor at first and i let it go now months later i do not wear these every day there are major sections of the sole completely worn off and a support wire inside has popped outi sent pictures and a description to the dockers customer service email and have never heard back
took almost weeks for delivery and were a little to large

these are not very comfortable to wear very long they hurt the tops of my feet
i absolutely love the look of this shoe and the fact socks dont need to be worn with them i returned the normal size i always get since they felt way too big went down half a size and they were fairly tight i stuck with the smaller size since i dont want to wear socks with them and the hope theyd break in just a little they have just a bit this shoe runs slightly narrow in the toe box and no support for running which i assumed before buying they arent as breathable i thought they would be as well the biggest issue ive had is even just walking my dog in them the insoles constantly would move id have to take off my shoe and adjust it multiple times in just a few miles i had to glue them down i really love the look but if youre actually moving in them they dont perform i prefer nike flyknit free run shoes if you want sockless shoes you can actually walk in
bei diesen schuhen ist schon beim ersten tragen der stoff vorne an der schuhspitze am bergang zur sohle gerissen nach zweimal weiterem tragen auch an anderen stellenmein sohn hat sich einfach nur normal damit fortbewegt dafr das es markenschuhe sind sehr rgerlichsind dies berhaupt originalschuhekann ich mir nicht vorstellen
schlechte qualitt hatte schon nach einer woche vorne ein loch im stoff jetzt nach einem sommer ist die sohle schon sehr abgelaufen und eigentlich knnen sie direkt in den mll ich hatte von puma eigentlich mehr erwartet
mein sohn trgt sehr gerne puma sportschuhe in verschiedenen ausfhrungen seit jahren diese sportschuhe sind leider mit abstand die schuhe die nur nach mal tragen ein loch an der spitze hatten ich denke ein schuh in dieser preiskategorie sollte schon bisschen lnger haltendie sterne gibt es frs aussehen und die elastizitt
eigentlich mag ich socken von nur die aber diese sind nichts ultra dnn mit noch dnneren stellen die einem dann als belftung verkauft werden ich halte es eher fr eine sollbruchstelle auch sind die socken sehr rutschig man rutscht im schuh der bei mehreren anderen marken socken gut sitzt wie verrckt herum nervig gut dass ich nur ein paar zum probieren bestellt habe
they look good and ok material quality if you want to wear them for sitting at your desk they are fine but they provide zero support and although fitting snug the material is so weak that your feet are flying left and right its feeling dangerous at many points i twisted my ankle first time running with them when making a change in direction i find them dangerous and wont wear them for work out
ive owned at least pair of allen edmonds shoes over the years so i was particularly disappointed with these the fit with my usual size eee was uncomfortably tight length and width and the leather seemed thin and far from what ive come to expect i returned them immediately
are you kidding me i wear a but i ordered a and they are still sizes too small there is actually a sticker on the bottom id say that the is equivalent to a size 
i normally wear a size womens i ordered size the shoes arrived with stickers on the soles stating that they are size size in europe is the equivalent of a size here so they should have been large for me instead they are so small i cannot even squeeze my feet into them i will be returning them tomorrow
i normally wear a but ordered a these were so small there was no way my foot would even come close to squeezing in
not great for kids with wide feet
meine gro ist normalweise aber es ist klein mit diese shuhemchte gerne was soll ich machen 
damaged products received times disappointed with quality of skechers first time quality related issue in skechers
chaussures portes une aine de fois les semelles se dcollent les coutures donnent des signes de faiblessepassez votre chemin
these are terrible i cant believe theyre actually skechers i have worn many skechers shoes of different types over the years and have bought many different kinds for my girls these are the first pair ive ever felt that have super uncomfortable interiors theyre water shoes so theyre meant to be worn without socks yet the inside seam where the fabric backing is stitched to the main part of the shoe is so scratchy my girls each tried on a pair and both were exactly the same inside so i am returning both well be going with speedo brand water shoes this year
the shoes are nice but they dont have the proper size chart loaded on this amazon page these little kids shoes say age my soon to be years old son wears a size toddler shoe so i thought since the size was on sale i would get it for him to grow into later turns out its the same as a toddler size shoe why dont they say age toddler then and the big kid size must really be for little kids shoes are great just need a better description and size chart hope this helps any other mom wondering the same 
sie sind anders als abgebildet vorne nur stoff
the product is not sold as advertise it is too hard on the foot and feels more plastic then rubber
yo pedi talla mx y llego una totalmente diferente es mas el producto que se ve en la imagen tiene agujeta y el que a mi me llego trae velcro
los tenis esta muy chicos yo quiero cambiar los tenis quera un nmero de mxico y segn yo deca as en los que peci
the rim of the heal area rubs at the back of the ankle
not comfortable at all
loved the fit and color of this sneaker however less than a week out of the box and normal wear the side of the shoe ripped really surprised that that happened
item not as described not real leather all man made which led to squeaking and sore heels very disappointed too late to return
son muy lindos pero la calidad no es buena apenas tenan dos dias de uso y se descosturo la lengeta
very disappointed it was advertised as leather but this is a plastic shoethe shape did not seem right either i own several pairs of docs and those just dont seem right
do not wear these for indoor basketball they slip and slide all over the place good for looks only not function
i dont have big feet by any measure but i found these shoes to be far too tight squishing my feet despite me ordering one size larger than my actual size i tried wearing them once and they gave me such cramps i had to return them
pour la maison au bout d une semaine le talon s est completement use et fendu tres mauvais produit
i know toddlers wear out shoes like crazy but the inner part of the shoe seems always humid and the leather looks terrible after a few weeks even with extra protection the boots look bad
el producto que recib son dos zapatos para el mismo pie pie derechotodava tendr que realizar la devolucin y pagar por eso
runs small very narrow across the heel and through the top of the foot also super hard inside the footbed is nice but everything else is really rigid she said they were almost painful to stand in
it seemed like a quality product but unfortunately it is not meant for those with wide or slightly chubby feet i should have realized this now that i think back to the original toms i even bought a size bigger
my son got a hole in the toe of his shoe after only a month of wearing so disappointed in the quality
bequemer schuh nur die adidas streifen lsen sich nach paar mal tagen schon absehr sehr schade
the fit is soooo narrow i have a wider foot but even if i didnt it wouldnt fit because the seam by the toes fits right on the bone by your big toe and it is extremely painful to just put on the quality looks good but i wouldnt have a clue how they actually work because of the fit returned them
a bad experience the shoe has only been worn for the second time the sole has fallen off and the shoe body is too hard
produit de qualit trs moyenne la semelle suse plus rapidement que dautres souliers javais eu en gros rabais et mme l je ne rachterais pas
my son loved the shoes they were comfortable and fit well the shoes laces are held in place by a piece of string and it broke a few days after we received them i contacted amazon right away and they instructed me to contact adidas for a refundexchange i submitted my request to adidas on july as requested by adidas customer service when i didnt hear anything after a few weeks i emailed them again several emails sent asking about an update went ignored i had to use the chat feature on the adidas website to get an answer i was finally issued a return label and sent the shoes back and they were received on august i followed up with customer service again and i was told i would receive an email update after business days the time it takes to inspect the item and then the gift card would be issued within business days this still has yet to happen when i contacted customer service again they now changed their story and said that because i didnt purchase the shoes directly from adidas i would not receive my gift card until business days after the shoes were received i am now being told that i wont receive my gift card until september which is months after i submitted all of the required information to adidas to start this process i will not be making any more purchases of adidas products
bought these for my year old he likes the sleek look of adidas but we wont buy these again purchased midfebruary and by early may the soles were worn completely through in several places i dont mind spending more on name brand shoes because the quality usually matches the price but thats clearly not the case with these shoes very disappointed in the adidas brand weve had sneakers from walmart last longer than this waste of money
these are very comfortable shoes but my son has gone through pairs since april of course he grows out of them quickly so im replacing them anyway but every pair has literally been falling apart after only a few months it would be nice if they could at least be used for playyard shoes but they arent even in good enough shape for that we are going back to buying nikes
my son has only worn these for six days and they are literally falling apart he loves the fit and how light they are but its very disappointing that they look like this after less than a week
material da correia bem ruim j arrebentou vai ter que ser como antes colocar preguinhos na correia para usar chinelo havainas por mais tempo
i was so excited for these shoes for my son that i disregarded all of the negative reviews but now i am stuck with the shoe that my son cannot wear because he literally tripped and fell out of the shoes because the strap is too short i even sewed an extension on the strap to help make it longer and the velcro that is attached to the shoe is very weak so here i am stuck with very expensive shoes for my yearold that i spent a lot of money on please do not purchase these you will definitely be disappointed
my son loved the shoes very vibrant color very good looking very comfortable would be a great shoe if not the design defect in velcro that keeps the shoe attached to the kid the receiving part of velcro is just about half an inch in length there is no way its enough for a kid who is running around as soon as he starts running the velcro detaches and shoes become useless i hope adidas fixes that defect in otherwise wonderful shoe
the shoes have gold in them which is not pictured as well as no velcro item is not as described
not enough backheel support foot slides right out back i returned these although i had a bit of a fiasco with that as had ordered a few pair of shoes and sent these to wrong place and place sent them to acted like did not have so ended up having to pay for these a bit frustrating luckily werent too costly but im not inclined to try out shoes so much now
huh these are genuinely ugly
i received my st pair with the straps much to small to fit my feet but i could not adjust the straps at all like the straps were glued into position i returned the st pair asking for a replacement the replacement had the same problem the straps could not be adjusted when i returned the nd pair i was charged an restocking fee despite that they were listed as free returns
have owned many pairs of this shoe usually very durable the shoes no longer come with vibram soles and after only a month and a half of normal use the sole is already delaminating from the shoe unacceptable for this price
leider war an der tte ein schild gr inhalt jedoch retour
incomodas
seems these are made with less care then i would have hoped for there is glue clearly used to put the shoe together that has not been cleaned up at all and they are too tight to wear i hope they loosen up with use
quality these do not seem like authentic adidas they have a very strange look in person i do not like them at all and nor does my childfit i wouldnt recommend ordering these but if you do make sure your kiddo has a narrow foot and order a half size up at least
i thought adidas would offer a quality material but my year old son already was able to wear it out the tip of the shoes within two months all he has been doing with the shoes is walking running biking playing in recess outside in school he does not play soccer so kicking or something like that is not the reason why the fronts torn out
looked great to start but after a few short weeks the front plastic toe started to crack open typical daily use would not recommend this product
en cuanto al producto ni una queja son muy comodos el pero es para el color recibido que aun habiendo pedido marrones me las envan en color gris
arrived in a non genuine box with no merrell labels of any kind either on the shoes or box i highly doubt these are genuine and yes they were from amazon not a third party seller
merrell is no longer a brand of longevity but it still costs the same as it used to
die schuhe sind getragen oder unter eine walze gekommensohle kaputt unmglich so einen artikel zu verschickentotal dreckig
la qualit e buona ma e del 
scarpa molto scadente indossata volte e si gi scollata la suola
son lindos pero son demasiado grandes si ped mi talla pero igual estn muy grandes
i like ecco shoes i have a couple of pairs i was looking for something to slip in and out easily for work with arch support these fit the image but they scratched the top of my foot there is no inner lining so everything feels rough had to return
liked the style and color i tend to need a narrow heel with a medium width foot bed ecco usually works for me but this shoe slipped in the heel and i had to return them they ran wider than usual
ive had it for just a few months and its starting to wear the other ecco shoes i have keep going for years
the tongues have a lot of loose threads on both shoes its really comfy otherwise and breathes extremely well i dont like seeing so many loose threads though it makes me wonder how many other spots that i havent or cant see have sewing problems too its a shame because its very comfy otherwise
if you have young healthy feet this product may be for you i have wide worn down feet and this shoe has zero support it is easy to operate but the padding is less then effective
im a narrow i bought these because i needed a snicker that could hold my ankle while working out after an injury thats not the shoe for that the high top style is really for style there is no ankle hold i was also struggling a lot to get my foot in and outlooks really cute its light weight but i had to send it back it was too much of a hassle and did not fit my purpose
i love puma shoes it is basically all i wear but very disappointed when my shoes arrived and i opened to see them with stains on them and look as if they been worn prior to sending and its a real hassle to return right now during all this stuff going on i fe like i just got swindled out of my money
wir hatten noch nie hausschuhe die nach kurzem unregelmigem tragen so ausgesehen haben nicht mal um ein vielfaches gnstigere ich habe beim mangelpaar ersatz angefordert und das ersatzpaar sieht jetzt so aus also habe ich jedenfalls kein montagsprodukt erwischt ich kann die guten rezensionen berhaupt nicht nachvollziehen bei uns ist nanga unten durch
unlike other ugg slippers ive purchased this pair had thin sole and little support
junk i bought these shoes for my granddaughter to play softball and she wore about times and now theres a crack on the bottomtry to upload a photo or take a picture picture of it it just gives me the runaround check settings i check my settings and theyre turned on to upload photos also have the camera still cannot share a pic
they are cheaply made they smellhorrible the zippers came all messed up and barely functional and above all they are sized like childrens shoes i dont have wide feet at all and i couldnt even get my toes in the shoes what an absolute waste of my money
bonjourje suis trs due car achet la paire de chaussure en fvrier et aprs le confinement elle ne sont pas du tout impermabledonc je demande le remboursement ou lchange ci les nouvelles sont impermable comme le prcise le garantiemerci par avance de me donner les modalits pour avoir enfin une paire de chaussure garantie impermable comme prcis sur le coupon merci par avance de votre rponse cordialement
the media could not be loaded every step both shoes makes a clicking sound wow so bothersome unless you want to annoy your golf buddy when he is putting
i direct golf commercials for a living ive used every brand on the planet these shows are junk they spandex material is so stiff that it will cut into your ankles without super long socks i hate anything but ankle socks these arent great shoes
el producto es bueno y de calidadpero en cuestin de las tallas son confusas seleccione una talla de cm y la talla que me trajeron fue la us que es la equivalente a la talla de cm por suerte lo pude usar como regalopero si deben mejorar esto ya que no especifica si la seleccin de la talla que traen es en cm o pulgadas
the shoe is stiff and hard and ran a bit on the small side for me it squeezed my feet together and after a few hours my feet was hurting
it is ok but not very great shoe
this product doesnt deserve even one star but i had to select it n order to submit my review im so disgusted that these boots r so fake its totally obvious to the naked eye u just cant tell from their pic real timbs r much heavier have rows of stitching instead of nice try r of better quality leathersuedenubuck also weatherproof im not sure what fabric these r made of but its cheap and the ones i received all appear to b wiped off which is weird because i ordered pair from different groups toddler little kids big kids maybe if this were my first time owning a pair i couldve been fooled but then again theyre so cheaply made i strongly doubt it i foolishly purchased these even after seeing another reviewer have a complaint of their boots separating after just wears i just thought maybe that individual pair was defective i shouldve known better since ive always paid way more for all of my other timbs i just saw the price thought they were too good of a deal to pass up especially since timberlands prices have skyrocketed ridiculously this past year i spent slightly less than on pair of these so i initially saved about total but whats the point when im gonna end up spending more to replace them when they fall apart im disappointed because i anxiously awaited my package for nearly a week and crap is what arrived if u have never owned timberland boots before then i suggest u go to an authorized store that sells them so u can at least feel see what type of boot u should b receiving when ordering online if u have timbs then it wont take u but a second to spot these knockoffs i received the pair that i purchased for my loved ones today and pair r going rite back today i wasted my time but i will not waste my money dont b like me by ignoring the reviews and buying these anyway buyer beware unless u just dont care
i purchased these boots for my grandson when i received them they were filthy and showed obvious signs of wear and tear to say that i was disappointed is an understatement
the box was torn and not in good condition the boots although listed as brand new had some white residue on the bottom of the boots to my surprise i tried the boots on my son today and i was sent two different sizes what is going on here
the reviews about the comfort of the soles made me buy theseand that they were listed for running and stability i wont get to try out the soles because the shoes are useless for running etci have entirely flat feet with a wide toe box loose ligaments i need corrective shoesorthotics arent enough new balance let me run but i gotta say they are moving away from structure and support and overpronationwhich is what this shoe was listed mistakenly to address its a sock with no structure on top of a foamy platform id worry about ankles with the platform height the sole wont hold up to track or terrain or even miles of grass indoor shoes for so this is new balances new sketchersnotworkoutline of shoessizing was right on they look just like the picturewhich is a step up from the vinyl models but just barely
ive never tried on a pair of fresh foam nbs before i read the reviews before buying them and overall what i anticipated receiving certainly wasnt what i got they were the correct shoes and the correct size but the second i stood up in them the question that immediately popped out of my mouth was wheres the foam theres next to no cushioning in these shoes and the instep is very narrow needless to say they are heading back to the return center tomorrow
initially pleased with these shoes but after only three months they are showing way more wear and tear than they should cloth around the top is fraying all around my biggest concern though is wear metal loop that the start goes through the loop is failing and looks like it will soon break rendering these shoes worthlessupdate velcro gave out shoes falling apart didnt even last a year super disappointed
be aware that the description is incorrect these are not big kid sizes they are little kidtoddler sizes
disappointed with the quality especially at this high price as the elastic cord came undone literally the first time this shoe was used we decided to keep it as the shoe still seems to be functional and needed it immediatelymake sure to test the shoes you get before letting the kid wear them
diseo muy bonitopero a mi hijo le han durado menos de un mesno son zapatillas de deporte fuertesno esperaba tan mala calidad de una marca as
not as good as expected
should be advertised as narrow they are not wide
weve had these shoes maybe weeks my daughter has worn them maybe times already the strap felt apart and the fabric stitching on the shoe itself ripping we usually love new balance what a disappointment 
i dont feel like this shoe was designed to fit an actual foot the velcro strap is positioned in such a way it would only fit a totally flat foot since my daughter has a regularly shaped foot the strap cuts in on the top of her arch at an odd and uncomfortable angle are these actually made by new balance the shoes are very cute and would have been outgrown quickly anyway so not worth the hassle of return but very confused why new balance would create a shoe like this sizing was tts and the purple and green combo is adorable
il modello molto carino ma ahim si rovina facilmente la suola infatti si in molte parti consumata ed diventata quasi nera anche se alla mia bimba le ho messe solo in occasioni particolari e non tutti i giorni
the picture and description were misleadingthe picture is shown as white but the description says black very upsetting i wont be buying shoes from here anymore
mi pedido fue unos convers blanco y me llegaron negro
no es igual a lo que venden segn las imgenes del producto deforme ni la cantidad de agujeros para pasar el cordn coinciden 
am anfang war ich sehr begeistert von diesen schuhen leider hat sich die begeisterung gelegt kurze strecken zb als hausschuh sind voll ok aber sobald man etwas schneller werden mchte rutscht man usserst ungnstig innerhalb des schuhs herum durch die fehlende fersenkappe kann man den schuh sogar verlieren falls es noch schneller werden sollte leider daher nur als hausschuh empfehlenswert als straenschuh untauglich
leider sehr weit
kleber hlt nicht schlechte ware wir bitten immernoch um geldzurck oder ein retouren schein warum wird nicht geantwortet
schlechte qualitt bestimmt nicht orginal
leider waren die schuhe zu klein ich habe peranchreiben zurck geschickt jetz habe ich rechnung von firma paigo bekommen ich bitte sie um das fehler zu beheben
it took close to two weeks for these to be delivered now i cant return them i should be allowed more time to be able to return these as they did not work and were delivered much later than they should have been
i think i got used shoes it looks like they are full of sand
received the wrong size of product disappointed with customer service on issue considering i checked size times in buying process to insure i get product i need the issue was not fixed i was recommended to get off brand cheap knock off or pay over x the original price i bought these merrell shoes at i love merrell shoes for my bad ankles but i am disappointed with the customer service
caja contenedora completamente destrozada parecan que venan de un rastrillo no va con la imagen de amazon estas cosas hay que cuidarlas no se puede enviar cualquier cosa
diese schuhe sind ihr geld nicht wert nach nicht ganz wochen ist schon der erste reisverschluss kaputtschrottware blo nicht kaufen
not as described obvious defect in the leather that was used to craft this boot
my husband wore these around the house minutes after using them as a nightlight for two weeks yes these shoes in the color pantone are just that bright he says the shoes are the correct size the fit is so poor his heel comes out with each stepnot actual leather these shoes are nothing like the so called original reebok there is a material allowed to be called leather that is polyurethane attached to leather allegedly leather that i think is a leather constructed from dandruff scales removed with all the success of fracking
love thesegreat looking for sure but the material wears off from waternormal maintenance no chemicals used to wash youd do on a shoe i have two extremely lightly worn pairs that i got about months ago now the first i made mistakes on so got a second pairfound the mistakes were more or less unavoidable why i rate these low has nothing actually do to with the shoe or the weari rate them low because i bought these for dollars the first time and the second there no way they are worth even with low supply thats more than double for a shoe that wears easy dont do it look great but not for that price unless you buying them for a fit or just a single occasion
i depend on saucony products since this brand is one of the few that fit me well but this particular model is just incredibly painful to walk in feels as if youre walking barefoot on stones saucony is still my goto brand but will be very wary of prices that are too cheap as is said you get what you pay for
estos tenis lo necesito para trotar y me quedaron demasiado grandes cuando troto voy tropezando con la punta del tenis por lo grande que me quedanaqu en mexico siempre compro tenis del y siempre me han ajustado bien pero estos tenis vienen demasiado grandes
es la calidad nb pero lo metieron en una bolsa al venir de tan lejos sufri maltrato la caja de cartn delgado de los tenis se rompi y los tenis se aplastaron por eso doy dos estrellas la queja es por la paquetera que finalmente afecta el aspecto del producto tendr que limpiarlos y ormarlos
these were very disappointing they must be extremely old or knock offs
the sole of the shoe offers the kind of support and comfort you expect from a skechers shoe the topline of the shoe on the other hand feels like it has a piece of wire in it with little or no padding or protection to keep it from rubbing your foot this shoe scrapes the back of my heel when i walk and pinches the bridge of my foot when i go up stairs the more i wear the shoes the worse it is getting
the shoe is basically all plastic so it isnt very soft and the back digs into your heel had hoped it would soften a bit when worn in but i cant wear them unless i want to bleed the insole is also quite uncomfortable as there is no actual arch support just the gel foam which flattens under pressure i have other pairs of skechers i love but these ones are awful
these seem pretty cheap the back cuts right into my heelwhich is odd because i usually have problems with the heels being too big this has to do with the way the shoes are molded it actually curves into your heel going to stick with clarks
first clue these were not new shoes came in a box with rubber band around it there was no tissue paper noin the box just shoes shoes had no protective inserts in them there were no tags giving information about the shoes there was a plastic ring on one shoe to hold info but it was empty obviously these had been tried on andor used returned
i liked the shoes but after wearing them a short amount of time the back of the shoes rubbed my heels uncomfortably i have many pairs sketcher shoes and this is the first style that ive had this problem with
runs small and narrow quality is below what i expected
teva
todo lo de palladium me encanta son lindos sper cmodos en general siempre he estado muy satisfecha con cada par que he comprado la valoracin no tiene que ver con el producto sino con la talla y que aunque dice que es de mujer mandan talla de hombre as que siempre va a quedar grande
this sneakers looks good good quality the size is not as described on this item i chose for women but it is for men
its comfortable and definitely suggest ordering at least size smaller im a and i ordered a and there is still some wiggle room brand new out the box letters were coming off so i dont trust this quality muchupdate see last picture month in and bottom part is peeling out

my wife loved the designcolor of the propet womens w sneaker classic taupe however she had to return them because they were too small all of her shoes are m and she received a m size this time also however the cutstyle of this shoe must be different because for some reason they were too tight on her feet she was disappointed because apparently they do not make a size m and she was doubly disappointed that she had to pay the return shipping of over of the cost of the shoe buyers beware
had to return fit to big
the shoes look and feel great my husband has been looking for a good sturdy pair of shoes without getting dad shoes very comfortable our sons and now was some tooupdate the side of the shoe came apart after minimal wear very disappointed thought we had finnaly found a winner
we were moving and i must have missed this just now opened the box wrong size box says w shoes say would love to return these but its been too long to do so be sure to check inside your box for the right size before its too late wish i had darn
first i am a huge adidas fan it and other are the only brands i wear but these are a no they look normal but when they showed up they are stiff and feel very cheap sorry i havent returned them so they are just hanging out in my closet also they run big so if you make the mistake of buying these order them one and a half sizes smaller
cheap and probably not actually adidasthey looked like crap after wearing them for one day i followed the advice of other reviews and bought a size down so they fit correctly but the are just a very ugly poorly made shoe hard uncomfortable flimsy etc etc etc
these are the biggest shoes in the world i wear an the was enormous i ordered a i have two inches of room im giving up
kinda comfortable but order a size smaller because too big
los zapatos son muy lindos pero aprietan esas tiras negras
ive been wearing merrell slipon hikers for years every year i buy a size m fits perfectlynot this time shoe wont even go on my foot feels more like a size or despite being labelled a maybe i will brave an actual shoe store try some merrells on again see what size now is the new m
trop petit impossible de mettre un pied
i wear mens regular width shoes my feet have been this same size for the past years and i have been wearing merrells pretty much exclusively for the past decades why consistency because they have always fit and they have always fit as if bespokethis pair was so narrow i couldnt get my foot into the shoe and were a good one inch longer heeltotoe when compared with the jungle moc i was wearingweird small
these shoes look well made but they are incredibly narrow all my life i have worn size to i ordered this is to be safe i couldnt even get my forefoot into them they were insanely narrow merrell makes a quality product but they seriously need to fix their sizing
despite having had several pairs of merrell mocs these could not even be put on without fear of breaking a shoe horn understanding that they ran smaller than typical i ordered one size larger than my others but could only barely try them on so sent them back i wish they fit as well as others like the desert moc as they are good looking
they run way small or are mislabled
fr eine premium marke eine enttuschungdiese schuhe sehen schn aus wenn man die nicht trgt leider ist die qualitt so miserable dass ich die schuhe nach ca monaten entsorgen muss das bmw logo lst sich nach krzester zeit die schuhe sind sehr eng geschnitten quasi sehr ungequem der stoff an den fersenbereich stark abgenutzt obwohl ich die schuhe nicht so oft trage sehen die aus wie jahre benutzt als deko knnte man die schuhe nehmen mehr auch nicht
not suitable for road running very thin sole price very high and product is not useful for long distance running on hard roads i developed pain in my knees and toes after using these shoes for running in military training academy due to severe pain in knees i purchased another regular running shoes which went quite easy for me to run then after i urge dont buy this product as it is too expensive and useless
ich habe fr einen mann einen recht schmalen fuss und normalerweise eine schuhgre von aufgrund der vielen bewertungen und hinweisen zu den gren bei puma habe ich gre gekauft und der schuh ist immer noch eindeutig zu klein und vorne vor allem auch zu schmal was soll das
size indicators very misleading this shoe approximately two sizes smaller than average
el producto no es como esperaba encima de mala calidad
very narrowdoes not stretch
pedido devuelto no es el producto descrito no son brooks reve envan unas reebok
ordered wide width and it is too snug and shoes are hard to walk in
extremely tight
i was sent old worn out shoes
die bestellung kam pnktlich die schuhe sehe gut aus aber leider sind die etwas zu klein ausgefallen aber sonst zufrieden
ive bot other teva sandals and liked them but this shoe looked as if was a knockoff
so the actually boot is good seems to be built well pretty comfortable and for being a saftey shoe the toe box is roomy and doesnt cramp my toes my issue is buying shoes online the fist boots i bought were to big so i had to return them however there wasnt an option to return and get a different size i had to start a return which by the way took almost weeks to get my money back then buy another pair of boots in a different size these fit better but are still a bit too loose but honestly i cant any longer because i meed saftey boots for work that wardrobe plane they offer didnt work for me because amazon does not accept debit cards on that service
vaya por delante que el producto en s est muy bien es una muy buena zapatilla pero os cuento mi caso y es que de primeras yo me equivoqu al pedir la talla ped un y me mandaron una talla ms un me puse en contacto con atencin al cliente y me hicieron una devolucin y las volv a pedir esta vez la talla correcta un pero me lleg una talla vuelvo a ponerme en contacto con atencin al cliente y me hacen un cambio y me mandan otras zapatillas y llegaotra vez el vuelvo a ponerme en contacto con atencin al cliente me hacen una devolucin y las vuelvo a comprar un y me vuelve a llegar un numero as hasta en ocasiones me ha llegado un nmero ms del pedidohe desistido y ya no las he vuelto a comprar prefiero perder el buen precio al que las compraba a estar esperando y que me vuelvan a venir mal
las zapatillas son igual q en la foto pero ni siquiera las he puesto pq ped sabiendo q tallan pequeo y uso y me han mandado el despus de devoluciones siguen mandando el 
ive had merells before and i love them but this shoe was not made well i have a tough hike coming up and i bought these to train for it and i took it on one mile hike and the bottoms were worn down completely and one sole was coming off the lettering inside the shoe was completely erased but thats just aesthetic the worrisome part was the soles coming off after one hike i had my shoes for one week and they looked like i had them for years this shoe did not perform and i would never purchase these again i returned them and bought different merrells
jadore ces bottes mais malheureusement elles ne font pas mon enfant car il a le pied lgrement bomb sur le dessus et cette botte est troite sur son dessus donc elles ne conviennent pas tous dommage car jaime le model
muy bonitos lleva como puestas i ya se estn descosiendo
i purchased a size to wear walking hiking and maybe light running while on my camino de santiago journey i normally wear an to a my smallest and biggest toes were visible through the side fabric of the footbox because they are so small the padding under the ankle was so tight that it was painful even after loosening the shoe laces these are by far the most uncomfortable shoes i have ever tried on
absolutely the worst shoe as far as comfort goes okay support looks cute huge let down on comfort it actually felt like i had no cushion at all between the shore and the floor totally missed the mark on this one saucony
fake shoes
besides fit one of the most important features of a wintersnow boot is how warm it keeps your feet my feet are blocks of ice in these within minutes of going outside here in vermont i do not recommend unless your choosing a boot purely for aesthetics
these boots are very nice but way too small i wear a ee nobody makes a anything so i ordered an e to allow for thicker socks i could barely get my bare foot in the boot these will be going back unfortunately
i love the shoes the style i wish the part that meets the rubber was a bit widerto push my foot in hurts managed to get my foot in itmay need to send it back and go even more wider
un de mais souliers avait un cordon avec un big noeud j ai du couper le cordon tellement le noeuf tait serr et erreur de couture pas ma meilleure achat
der artikel war viel zu gro wurde mit kostenlosem rckversand zurckgenommen aber dann nur mit cent rckerstattet absolute unverschmtheit nie wieder dieser verkufer
nice sneakers but not new as seen in the photo they have already been used they are small in size about half the size my wife usually wears but this model is small for her i think size would be just right
i ordered these shoes for work im on my feet hours a day i always wear reebok and never had a problem however i ordered my normal size and these were more like a narrow beeare it would have cost me more time and money to return these i wore them for minutes and had to take them off lost and the shoes are still in the box in my closet im starting to believe these arent actual reebok but knock offs
had this type before so thought it would be same size and same comfort but not so would not buy again
i wore this shoe twice before the insole starting riding up toward my arch and when i tried patting it back down it stuck tight in a bunched up position they are very painful to use like this it is like walking with a wad of cardboard in your arch and the heel is decompressed because of the lack of insole what terrible quality
ordered these twice and both times received the wrong size so i gave up if they sent the right size i might have really liked them theyre very cute
i really regret purchasing this shoe the laces are horrendous to tie and are made from very cheap material save yourself some money and look elsewhere
i first ordered these shoes in size and the fit was at lest a whole size too big i ordered a second pair in and was sent a instead very disappointing
the sole started to come off after the first use
i have an older version of this zip up sneaker that i love this new gen styleisca miss for ne sadly will be returning
das design ist witzig vom material darf man nicht viel erwarten ist halt kunstleder wenn schuhe zu weit ausfallen bekommen sie auf dem spann gehfalten das zermrbt das material und es fngt an zu reiender schuh fllt weit aus keine gute passform hab ihn zurckgesendet das ging reibungsloszwei sterne fr das design
hallo der schuh ist sehr schn habe ihn gleich x gekauft einmal f die schule u einmal f zuhauseallerdings lst sich relativ schnell das gesicht bei uns schon nach wochen was sehr schade ist da dies ja gerade das se an dem schuh war ist also nur aufgeklebt sonst ist der schuh robust
i ussually wear size but this one are really big
they are too narrow and they run about a half size too small they are also very stiff and not comfortable
my son wears a i ordered a couldnt even get them on his feet id recommend sizing up at least sizes
si no quieres tener problemas pide media talla o una talla ms son muy estrechas pero son preciosas y ligeras
for some reason my left shoe feels like i have a rock on the side of my shoe when i run but when i take it off theres nothing there
this shoe is beautiful and seems to be of a very good quality but it didnt fit my boy it was too small and narrow
these are slides not the shoes in the picture at all
i did not receive what was shown in the picture instead i received slides
i ordered a new shoes with a good pricei received a used shoes todayeven i check again my invoice it shows i ordered a new shoesif from the beginning the seller indicated the item is used one then i would not disappointmentthere is no inner paper inside of shoes as a brand new onebottom of shoes is dirty and some foreign matter is stuck on thereshoe lace tied is not the same left and rightit makes me so frustrating
these shoes were mislabeled advertised as wide shoe was tight to the point that it hurt just putting them on
i did not like the design that didnt have a separate tongue it made it difficult to get the shoe on
i am so disapointed they are too small too narrow stiff and did not come with a packing slip so not sure how to return them as i can not wear them they are a pretty colour but unwearable
the shoes were shipped in a zip lock bag ridiculous as much as we pay for this shoe it shouldve been in a box plus the shoes is so tight and hard to put on i even ordered one size up
nach nur monaten sind die riemen an beiden schuhen bereits eingerissen ganz schlechte qualitt keine kaufempfehlung
der schuh wirkt billig er ist viel zu eng hat berhaupt nicht gefallen auf den fotos sieht er schner aus
this model is very very tight even whe it is my usual size as you can see i have pairs of reebok shoes in pictures at home and only the flashfilm are very very tight all my shoes are the same size us follow up double checking on ebay i found these shoes are designed for women am dissatisfied
these sneakers are comfortable my size is and they fit me well a little loose in width but my biggest complaint is a very strong chemical smell its an unbearable it makes me sick im going to have to leave them in forgetting and looking for others in what i find out how to take away that horrible smell
omg they look goodbut smell awful i cant get rid of the smell for weeks already i washed them in the laundry and nothing its plastic smell very very strong and i read the comments and nobody told that they have the smellthats why i bought them
feel apart very quickly
they sent mens i ordered womens size and they sent mens size not once but twice i ended up ordering something else the quality and look were very nice if you are looking for a casual dress shoe very nice i just hope you get womens worth the money if it works out for you it didnt for me
first of all the shoes are really great and light weight the only issue i have is that ive had these for less than a week and worn them to work times and the tread is already wearing down i dont walk a ton at work so this was a disappointing surprise especially given the price point ill return these and continue the search for a decent work shoe
i wear a in almost every brand including rockport based on reviews i ordered a and even this was too bigtoe longerpointier than i expected or want so i wont be exchanginglaces oddly longshoe was very light and seemed well constructed
its a quality shoe but ive never purchased a shoe whose sizing is this far off im a size mens usually wide width depending on manufacturer but if i had to guess i would say this thing is a size or 
these sneakers were not what i was expecting at all the material was very hard and not at all pliable i did not like the way they looked but i could have lived with that if material had been better also i was expecting aerosole type soles and these were not the same as my other aerosole shoes
this shoe is so cute the design runs large it wide through the top of the foot and heel and it is stiff and does not aloe you to walk comfortably i did return the shoe
now that i have the the time i would like to say that the sneaker is not all that for the price of bucks the ones i bought before the white ones were ten times better and please if the product doesnt deserve a star make it possible for submitting the information without having to give a simple star
pessimo colore
no son de atletismo ni para correr
also meine schuhe waren dreckig was hat mich irritiert
der schuh so ist sehr schn und auch bequem aber leider ist der rechte schuh breiter als der linke und so mit nur tragbar fr den hof
roza en el taln
son lindos pero son demasiado grandes si ped mi talla pero igual estn muy grandes
way to big
leider haben die schuhe klebereste zudem wird der stoff total faltig nach paar mal tragen dabei sind es nicht meine ersten schuhe dieser firma bis dahin war immer alles okay
no se ajusta a la numeracin quedaba grande los gastos de devolucin fueron mucho dinero por algo que no vale
die schuhe sehen wirklich schn aus wie bereits in den rezensionen zu lesen kommt man wirklich schwer in den schuh rein mit dem schuhlffel klappt es gut fie ffnung der schuhe ist so eng sodass meine fe arg abgeschnrt wurden ich habe keine dicken fe aber sie sind mir nach krzester zeit in den schuhen eingeschlafen gehen leider wieder zurck
devolvemos el producto porque era demasiado pequeo y jams recibimos nuestro reembolso estamos hace meses reclamando la devolucin del dinero y no hemos recibido respuestas no recomendamos para nada este proveedor estamos muy disconformes exigimos una solucin
i have had these shoes for a few months now i mostly use them as a casual sneaker but have done some limited running they are very comfortable and are holding up nicely i have not owned any reebok shoes in recent years i usually wear a size in nike and under armour these reebok shoes are a little larger perhaps a would fit but the size is not bad at alledit downgraded to two stars within six months these shoes started falling apart i only wore them about days per week not durable
on the first day of wearing these my big toe joint was in pain i could not wait to get home to get these off the lacing system has a chunk of material embedded into the foam and that embedded piece dug in and caused no shortage of pain threw the pair away before the first week with them
ended up in trash knock offs be warned
ordered a size and it fit about two sizes too small i ordered pairs of shoes and tried the other that fit perfectly by the time i tried to put on this pair it was past the day policy and i cant return if anyone needs a size let me know
shoes are roughly sizes larger than all my current size us shoes and i ordered us i cant give a proper review on the shoes themselves yet as i cannot wear them
these shoes look great but they are way too long for the size made in india i ran into the same problem in the past with clarks made in india they seem to have real qc issues at their factory i usually wear wide i ordered w and w based on previous reviews the w felt a size longer i went back and ordered size w these felt narrow and still were a bit longer than regular size i added for comparison photos side by side of clarks navy leather size w and sperry tan leather size m
i ussually wear size but this one are really big
they are kind of like the cheap made in china shoes you would find at the dollar store you know made for people with square feet no support and they only feel good if tied very tight i cant imagine these are actually adidas shoes
fake adidas glue on the sides box was all crushed if it was real adidas they would provide an extra pair of laces they are really cheap good looking but cheap and fake
nice but size seems to be if not too big for me hence returnedpacking was not good sent in soft brown paper bagthere was no return label included in the box should not happen not all customers have printers at home
i just didnt like the style of the sneaker on my feet it felt ok on my feet it looked too manly on me
useless after month of light usesevere knee paininto garbage
great design but uncomfortable
what a let down nice looking shoes but they started to fall apart within months the soles at the toe started to come unglued you would think adidas would have better construction for soccer shoes
got these shoes and my son loved them only problem is is that the zipper broke on one of them now he cant wear them and im tore on what to do
at first i put these on at home and stood up on the carpet in them ahhh soft memory foam light weight flexible the side zipper is tight the laces are thick the leather feels like quality should be good right not so much im days in and im writing this with sore feet instead of writing you a story im just going to list the problems with these boots memory foam is too thin results in zero cushioning on hard surface while making your feet sweat profusely no arch support the inside is flatter than dollar store dress shoes no side to side support this means your heel will move and since they are light and flexible youll likely roll your ankleall this can be solved with buying a nice insert from sof sol like i did except there is still one more completely unacceptable problem small cracks in the sole yes water can leak up through the bottom of this boot between the tread resulting in wet feet i hope that was water at least i didnt slip in itthere is one really big positive these though the top of the boot where it meets your shin and calf is really nice there is nothing sharp or rough edged to make that uncomfortable in the slightest ive tried a lot of boots over my years of military contractor and corrections and the top half of these boots are best in the business too bad the bottom half is the most importantthankfully amazon has a great return policy and wonderful customer service
there is no arch support in this boot which makes it very uncomfortable wearing them all day i work ten hour shifts and my feet hurt really bad by the end of the shift i have also had these boots for barely over a month and the toe seams have already began to pull out and the toe is pulling loose i work in law enforcement which is what they advertise these boots for wear i do not recommend these boots as duty boots
horrible not even a year old and they are coming apart at the seams the sole is peeling away from the shoenot happy
i purchased this sneakers about months ago for my child quality is poor her first puma sneakers and i guess it will be her last one
the back of the shoe hurt my heels i expected these to be better quality disappointed
elles sont jolies mais beaucoup trop troites mon fils a pourtant les pieds fins et impossible de fermer lavant sans lui craser les orteils dommage
wrde ich nicht noch mal kaufen nach zwei wochen sind die sandalen kaputt gegangen 
une des attaches des scratch arrire sest dcousue au bout de quelques heuresqualit scandaleuse pour des kappa jai demand le remboursement
leider auch das zweite paar innerhalb krzester zeit defekt
my son wore his pumas for week before the front of both sneakers came apart from the shoe i notified the seller and amazon with regard to the issue a return was approved however i later found out that id have to pay to ship the shoes back despite the fact that i purchased these on prime it will cost me almost as much to send them back as it would to keep not im disappointed in this seller and in puma in general
so my son has only worn the shoes a few times because he always complained fron fay one that they were tight well after begging him to put his shoes on i tried to get them in and the obviously do not fit but i knew it wasnt possible because they are supposed to be a size well out of curiosity i check the tag inside and guess what they are not a size like i ordered they are a size apparently i recieved the wring size and never knew it but other than being sent the wrong size which makes them a useless pair of shoes and a waste of almost they are very cute and nicely made
les chaussures plaisent beaucoup ma fille et je pensais avoir achet des chaussures de qualit qui feraient tout ltmais au bout de deux semaines les chaussures semblaient avoir plusieurs mois dusure avec une dcoloration du cuir les languettes qui rebiquent et la semelle sous le talon dforme je regrette cet achat
the top stretch cinch frayed and broke within weeks of wear my grandson loved the style although the shoe was generously sized the cinch was not stretched tight
ansich ein schnes und wertiges produkt die schuhe waren aber nicht neu sondern wurden bereits getragen gebraucht mit sand und erde zugestellt
leider nicht richtig vernht von innen und drckt an den fen richtig rein schade
i am grossed out i ordered these and inside is someones old dirty inserts they need to have better standards here for the price i have only just received and reluctantly put them on still grossed out btw and they are comfortable and i hope a good fit for hiking multiple terrians looks like someone already tried that thoughwish they would of left me a comment card along with their gross dirty inserts
these looked awful on unless you bowling shoes is the look you are going for then perhaps if worn ironically they might be okay but i was not and did not realize from the description that one half of each shoe was matte sort of suedey which i expected and the other side was shiny which i did not also tongue comes up kind of high which is not exactly comfortable but returning them mostly because they are ugly
too me their ugly i wear them too work only
love adidas all hands diwn but i couldnt put my foot into even the opening of shoe so sad pretty shoes
i like the fact that the shoes are comfortable and true to size yet they are so easily stained and hard to clean
seemed solid built but hurts my feet arch is too low or something now after wearing them to work for around months or so part of the sole is coming apartback to red wings it is
horrible boot the insole feels hard as a rock and the top of the boot puts a pressure point on the top of my foot that leaves me in agony after a couple hours in them total waste of money for me
initially pleased with these shoes but after only three months they are showing way more wear and tear than they should cloth around the top is fraying all around my biggest concern though is wear metal loop that the start goes through the loop is failing and looks like it will soon break rendering these shoes worthlessupdate velcro gave out shoes falling apart didnt even last a year super disappointed
be aware that the description is incorrect these are not big kid sizes they are little kidtoddler sizes
disappointed with the quality especially at this high price as the elastic cord came undone literally the first time this shoe was used we decided to keep it as the shoe still seems to be functional and needed it immediatelymake sure to test the shoes you get before letting the kid wear them
habe die schuhe bestellt weil in der beschreibung passform weit stehtdie schuhe sind aber ganz normal schmal sonst fr den preis schne echt leder schuhe
fake these shoes are obviously a lowquality replica couldnt believe these are sold by amazon
the lights on one of the shoes quit working weve had the shoes only a week or so my daughter is so disappointed
shoes are cute and fit just as expected but the second time worn the lights stopped working on one shoe
they were comfortable except the top part area the tongue is so thin it hurt the top of my feet when i tied them the material on those shoes is see through i can see my socks so im returning them
la scarpa presenta una buona qualit a livello di suola e chiusura a strappo per quanto riguarda invece la comodit mi aspettavo un prodotto pi morbido e confortevole mentre con mio grande dispiacere il materiale della scarpa piuttosto rigido soprattutto il suo interno ho scelto la scarpa con la certezza che geox non ha mai disatteso le mie aspettative ma questa volta mi sono dovuta ricrederepurtroppo
a little too big
no es fcil la devolucinno queda claro como hacerlo
queste scarpe de la puma meno di un mese e gia roto molto dispiaciuto
the first pair i bought started squeaking when i walked paid dollars for shoes the shoes were over the return period but the shoes were defective amazon agreed to except return after i spoke to a person but they only refunded so i lost for buying defective shoes they did give me a one time only credit for on products made and shipped by amazon only so i will not buy shoes from amazon again also makes me stronglyconsider if i want to continue my prime membership
look great but foot bed is super narrow with little support good for indoors and just walking but not for high intensity work outs also had to size up one full size they run small
the shoes fit tight and was flimsy on the side
it runs smaller very poorly glued together not worth 
they first began to fall apart about weeks into wearing them all the yellow rubber simply fall off it was put on with cheap glue ive warn them for months now and they are barely holding together the sole is completely falling apart pieces hanging off it everywhere and the seems are all coming undonefor only months of use ive never had a shoe fall apart so rapidly do not buy these they are complete junk and the return date only gives you month
maybe i should have gotten a size us but i have been wearing size for decades also there is still an easy half an inch in front of my toe in the shoe it pinches my big toes and pinky toes to the point where my right big toe is always numb and both pinky toes are well on their way to building corns blister stage atm to put it bluntly i cannot give this shoe a good review maybe my feet are strange but i doubt it considering that i have never had problems like this with a shoe before there is no way i would fit a in this shoe as i stated the empty space in front of my toe is around and i think more than a half of an inch which means that unless i really tighten up the shoe laces my foot slips forward and gets wedged even worse with a gap behind my heel the shoe can literally slip off if someone gives me a flat tire i know my feet might be a hair wide but this is an unmitigated nightmare i cannot recommend this shoe i am stuck with it until i can afford another
when i saw this and ordered them i was super excited because i love skechers shoes and flip flops however after a few weeks of wearing them the lining on the inside around the steel toe started to break and the steel toe started to rub up against my toes and made them bleed at that point it was too late to return them to amazon and since i hadnt bought them thru skechers i was out of luck with them too so this was a little frustrating because my feet are now have scars from this and it seemed like no one cared if i could give zero stars i would
truthfully i would have returned these if i had to wear them all day long since i only wear them for an hour or at a time when i visit work sites i decided to keep them because i needed a warm weather safety shoe the toe box is tighter than any other medium width shoe that i own and the steel toes are poorly padded and uncomfortable you are likely to find a better option with another brand or style i am a sketchers fan and very disappointed in these shoes
die angegebene schuhgre entspricht nicht der realitt viel zu kleindie gelieferten schuhe entsprechen eher der gre die lieferanten sollten die produkte besser prfen bevor sie in den verkauf gehen
komme mit dem fu erst gar nicht rein weil es zu eng ist
its not true to size run to smal
buyer beware only buy if you have skinny narrow feet
la zapatilla era bonita pero la devolv porque era pequea su nmero no se corresponde con la numeracin habitual al intentar comprar un nmero mayor el precio suba mucho
oh my god i had plantar fasciitis and was getting better i got these shoes and they literally killed my feet one month later i am still feeling the affects these shoes are not for people with issues with their feet
the product itself is a but im not sure why they deliver the wrong shoe size
part of the white trim on these shoes turned pink after two months they were worn times they were returned
le scarpe di per s non sono male ma dopo due sole settimane dallutilizzo si staccata la suola sulla scarpa sinistra e non c modo di rimetterla a posto pur sistemandola dopo un po si stacca nuovamente
un marchio del genere dovrebbe vergognarsi di vendere un prodotto del genere praticamente devastate dopo dieci utilizzicompletamente scollati i bordi attorno alla suola lultima volta a lavoro stavo per restare scalzomai pi scarpe levis
schn aber nicht bequem
i had the realflex cross trainers and they worked great the version is completely different i ordered the same size as the and it was about inch longer measuring side by side and much narrowerthey are very cute and will wear them for running short errands but not suitable for my hiit workouts and weight training like the s were the heel slipped inside the shoes when doing burpees and planks did not supporttried walking my dog in them today for about an hour and it pinched my pinky toe and was painful
ordered every other shoe fits perfectly at that size these were too big and unfortunately im past the return window second time with reebok and disappointed with size and quality ill stick with new balance
i have been using nike and adidas running shoes for the past years after going through the top men running shoes i decided to buy asics gelkayano for which higher price from any of my previous running shoes i started using it and after the first run i started to get annoyed because the shoes is either too tight tight or to loose after couple of runs i started to get irritation on the bottom of my feet which ended up to painful blistersfrom my experience the shoes is too expensive for what it offers its not comfortable fit is very irritating abd caused me a lot of pain to the point that i went back to use my two years old shoes that is still more comfortable than the new shoes not recommended over priced 
ive been a fan of asics kayano and this is my third pair this one im not a fan of the pair i have are comfortable for the bottom of my feet but very uncomfortable on the top i have to wear the laces way loose otherwise they start to hurt my feet not sure it its a defect it seems like itinsole is pretty good and so is the cushioning so disappointed with how they fit the bridge of my feet never had this problem before with any shoe
i had a pair of kayanos a few versions ago they were the best shoe ive had just the right combination of support cushioning and ground feel i literally ran the soles off of themthese are a different story i might as well be running in tap shoes as hard as these soles are its like running on boards you cant feel whats going on between your feet and ground and even a mile run feels like an effort the fit is expected the support is fine but they need to remove whatever kind of material they put in these soles
ive been running ascis kayanos non stop since ive gone through probably over pairs and they are usually perfectthese ones sucki was hoping there was just a break in period but they actually got worse my toes touch the laces are too short and they just dont feel the same when pounding the pavementi even looked into if these were knockoffs or counterfeit but it seems like everyone has similar experiences which is a shame i hope the next models are better
i have worn m mens asics kayano for yearslike more than a decade i usually take to amazon to buy last years model i liked this shoe bc of the glow features this shoe runs very narrow i visited my local running store lucked up and found an asics kayano from mens size m fits like every other pair i have owned
wir knnen vom kauf dieser schuhe nur abraten unsere tochter hat sie vielleicht mal getragen nun habe ich ein nicht sehr kleines loch in der sohle entdeckt die sohle scheint nicht aus einem guss zu sein sondern die unterschiedlichen farben sind anscheinend zusammengefgt zwischen schwarz und trkis lst sie sich nun aufwir hatten die schuhe eigentlich gekauft da sie laut produktbeschreibung wasserabweisend sein sollen leider ist das nicht der fall selbst bei leichtem nieselregen werden die socken auf dem mintigen schulweg nass
nach wochen sind die schuhe schon hinber die sohle nutzt sich extrem schnell ab und das material aus dem die schuhe sind macht keinen guten eindruck nach wochen jeden tag anziehenleider keine empfehlung
leider ist nach einer woche in gebrauch die klettverschlussschnalle an der naht abgerissenich werde die schuhe nun noch mal umtauschen vielleicht haben wir dann mehr glck denn mein sohn findet die schuhe ansonsten gut
in spite of their listed policy of prime shipping and free returns they dont actually offer this they will charge you shipping at checkout and you will pay shipping back to china if you decide to return its too bad because the shoes themselves seem pretty legit and comfy
these are so cute and a great dupe however they are very cheap and kill your feet the leather was sewed together very strange on the inside causing the sides to always dig in your foot three steps and they killed your feet also i am usually an and i ordered and because everyone said to size up and they still were too small
the shoes were purchased as a birthday gift for our son he wears a straight size and size was listed as a size to choose from size was not even an available option for purchase yet that is what we received unfortunately when he tried the shoes on they were very uncomfortable very tight at the heel and no room at the toe they are a good looking shoe and are well made too bad sizing isnt correct
i wear a regular width and these are good in the length but slim overall making them a tight fiti amwas really disappointed with the cushion since they only lasted about days walking dailybecause of the slim fit i found my feetlegs were getting fatigued walking in themwouldnt buy again and honestly wish i could return them

my yearold was in a size and these were too narrow and tight for him to wear for more than a few minutes we do not usually have to buy wide shoes and his feet arent very chubby we got them on and he could walkrun in them but he complained the entire time they are very nicelooking shoes and appeared to be very good quality but keep in mind they are very narrow i had to return them
st pair i ordered for my son his size but didnt fit so i ordered the next size up only to get different sizes and i was very upset i needed them for tomorrow not happy now i have to return those too 
leider recht unbefriedigend sie sind noch nicht ganz einen monat im einsatz und sehen schon so ausvorher hatten wir immer welche fr rund europaar von einer anderen marke und sie wurden eher zu klein als dass sie kaputt gingen wer gnstig kauft kauft zwei mal zudem finde ich das bndchen relativ eng und steif nur etwas fr filigrane fe und sehr dnne socken
despus de meses de haber comprado mis tenis se deterioraron exponencialmente se parti la piel y por la parte interior se enmohecieron no volver a comprar esa marca muy defraudada quiero un rembolso
i messed up and put these away for a special day and should have walked around in them sooner i didnt know there was a return date so close to when i purchased them i had an event to go to and decided it would be a good time to wear my new shoes i had them on for approximately minutes and it wore a sore in my back healankle area luckily i brought another pair of shoes to wear i am sure this problem will hurt anyone who tries to wear them they are defective my mistake i will pay more attention to the return date next time
i use as a kick around shoe i think i liked the looks of it the mostthis tennis shoe is almost all rubber and lacks solid support for a tennis shoe like others have commented it makes a strange annoying noise when i walk it may be that it does not bend easilywith all the grooves i thought it would breathe easily but it really does not breathe wellalso with all the grooves on the toe area it always looks dirty like there is a ton of dust in between all the groovesknowing what i now know i would not buy this particular model againhowever i really like other asics tennis shoes and will certainly consider them in the future
i always were asics tennis size and these were not only size too small but they were narrow and uncomfortable like a cheap payless shoe the heel slid around and i could not make the tight shoe even stay on my footi got a new size then wool socks since i like the design of the shoe but nothing worked this is not asics it did not feel like any of the dozens of asics shoes i ever boughtasics is making great shoes and as soon as they make one they discontinue the amazing product then they put out this garbage that is being discounted because its a design flaw that they should take back from resellersthis experience frustrated me so much that i am heading out on a mission today to find a new brand of shoes that i can depend on that doesnt have lame colors i would never buybye bye asics it was a great time while it lasted
die schuhe sind jetzt schon defekt das kann ja wohl nicht seinwie kann das sein 
despues de das intensos de trabajo las tengo que devolver por que me hicieron dao en el tobillo y no me las puedo poner se me inflamo el tobillo
purchased these sneakers on in five months the treads are completely worn away need a new pair have liked ryka shoes for a long time but this is not acceptable
not comfortable at all no spring in the step memory foam insole was even hard sending them right back
im very torn with this review the shoes are pretty comfortable but they wore out so fast i had them about a month and the bottom tread is completely gone already they did give me blisters at first but once i tightened them up that stopped i wanted to love them but needed to replace them way faster than i anticipated
unfortunately you cant give zero stars i ordered these shoes within two hours changed my mind and tried to cancel i was told that i couldnt because it was already in processing i received the shoes and tried them on only to find they were uncomfortable i no longer desired to keep them i opted for a return only to be told i would have to pay for the return shipping and wasnt guaranteed they would refund my money dont get scammed by this company sneakers are not worth the hassle or supposed comfort
these hurt a lot i could barely stand wearing them for weeks i ordered different boots already waste of money
these shoes are cheap and reflect their lower price not a lot of support under the ball of the foot and the memory foam in the sole is not very thick not very supportive for a long walk but they work for jumping in and out of the car to go shopping
no satisfaction for a true d is too small and too big everything i try in a at walmart fits perfectly th time i just got the and different inserts to fill the void dissatisfied
fr mich viel zu eng
i feel being deceived the picture did not match with what was sent to us similar but not the same
decent quality but nearly impossible to put on
i would like to change the product because it is very small
wir haben die schuhe in der farbe schwarz bestellt in der rechnung und auf dem schuhkarton stand auch schwarz als farbe doch uns wurden die schuhe in dunkel blau geliefert punktabzug gilt der falschen lieferungwir haben die schuhe in blau trotzdem behalten die farbe ist sehr schn und die schuhe sind wie erwartet sehr bequem
ich habe schon viele ua turnschuhe habe mir meine typische gre bestellt aber die hier sind so extrem klein und vor allem schmal das ging gar nicht ging retoure leider nur per dpd mglich dazu muss ich allerdings knapp km fahren auf mein geld warte ich noch ist aber auch erst tage her und nicht ber amazon sondern das sportgeschft
this gray black shoe as pictured and ordered is not what it appears it arrived and actually has a navy blueish tint to it not what i expected from the pictures when ordering i have good eye vision but maybe i need my eyes checked again ha it is however a great looking design
its a beautifully made shoe but way too small it feels like sizes too small
had to return it definitely buy a whole size bigger super tight
zu klein leider farbe und material ist toll
ya haba comprado varios productos en amazon y haba quedado satisfecho hasta ests sandalias llegaron la fecha indicada la talla y el color correcto solo un detalle que las sandalias se ven usadas llegaron con la suela sucia se ve como usadas y sin etiquetasestoy muy molesto no pueden vender productos usados como nuevos
these are the worst cleats i have ever had they are very stiff and i have blisters all over my feet ive played soccer since i was a child and these just wrecked my feet i got them because they are made for wide feet which they do well on that part but they are just super uncomfortable and too stiff to even try to break them in ive worn them almost times and each time my feet blister bleed toenails break etc
cleats are somewhat deep will try to return back to amzn
haben leider nicht lange gehalten reien an den seiten ein und der kleber lt sich auch von der sohle
looked great but first time wearing shoe lace started coming apart meant to return for replacement but buy the time i remembered past the days looks great but not as durable as i would hope 
shoe was very tight on my son could only fit him for a couple weeks
no me gustan para nada yo he tenido de est marca y siempre las he llevado cmodas pero estas son increblemente incmodas muy tiesas la parte de atrs se hace para delante y roza en todos los sitios siempre he usado un y estos aprietan y llevo aos confiando en est marca y la plantilla resbala muy difcil andar con ellos tiesos tiesos realmente no lo recomiendo para nada

lucky brand mens sarey ankle bootmiss ided these are womans booti knew going in that this style is a womens which i chose to get themfor the price the quality is just not therenicks in one heelglue around sole edgejagged edges between sole and upper near heelas part of the boot design the tips and back low heel area are a shinier compared to the matte look of the rest of the boottrue to sizefull zip on each boot to make easier to place oni have thicker calves and i was able to place on and zip up fullytop of the tips of the boots rub against toes but only in certain areas i can already tell that if i dont wear thicker socks it is going to cause blisters and quicklyall in all between the quality issues and weird rubbing i am disappointed in these

i ordered a lace up shoe and received a slip on cannot return because event is days away
aufgrund der positiven resonanz habe ich mir diesen schuh bestelltvoller vorfreude ffnete ich das paket und musste feststellen dass der kleber nicht richtig verarbeitet wurde siehe bildersehr rgerlichoffensichtlich bware wenn berhauptversand was zgig und unproblematisch
they are well made but they are heavy and uncomfortable
i received fake adidas from shoebacca i recommend buying directly from adidas
i bought this based on the recommendations they run small and do not stretch out much i like running but also need a pair for working in a warehouse which im always on my feet very disappointedim usually a but too small and then still uncomfortable and tight now i have to return them and pay for shipping
fatal hace muchsimo en la parte de atrs de la pierna para el precio que tiene y el dao que hace no merece nada la pena
i was so excited to received these because they looked so cool and flashy but immediately after i tried them on they were super uncomfortable the crease just above the top of the laces cut into my toes when i would bend my feet to take a step i was surprised because the reviews claimed to be comfortable and did not need any breaking in i must have got a bad pair i returned them for a different brand entirely
the back material and the front material inside the shoe isnt sewn together it looks like to me it should be a plastic like material is showing bn wont answer phone sent text and pics their website site said to do no response i guess i need to send back cant find out if it is a defect poor workmanship even if it is suppose to be like this i got the extra wide and it still feels a little tight the shoe strings are too short i had another pair of nb shoes in pass that the string whee too short i have to take the strings out of some of the whole to be able to have them loose enough to tie that pair was from years ago thought they would know by now to make their strings longer i have a high arch i dont know if that is the reason i need more string length but this is the only manufacturer that i have run into this problem if i but a pair of the mens i dont have that problem just some of their women tennis shoes i cant keep waiting for them to respond to tell me if this is a defect to send them back does anyone else that bought this show have the material inside the shoe look like this where the front material and the back material in the inside isnt sewn together please someone let me know since i cant get a response from nb

the outer shell is waterproof except for the tongue what a dumb decision any snow gets on the laces and the heat from the foot melts it through and freezes your foot
good shoes love the design but they are very stiff uncomfortable and cardboardy
as a cole haan wearer my entire life ive come to expect high quality materials and craftmanship in their products i purchased these shoes for my uncle who first introduced me to cole haan as a present after inspection i decided to return them immediately the fit itself was stiff and uncomfortable but most notably i found the materials cheap and plasticy my suspicion is that these are knockoffs if youre expecting authentic cole haans the price is too good to be true
not the same as the original pair these are quite different the leathers is stiff so much that it hurts my feet never buying this again
sure was almost two sizes too large my daughter is a i ordered a to be sure and i think im going to have to order a i measured her foot and its exactly inches long a shouldve been perfect this prob isnt real sketchers will be reporting for fraudupdate i just revived a size in black bc this color was not absolute about to a full size still too big idk what ill do
i made the mistake of not looking at the negative reviews these are not real leather these are made of plastic not only that but at the bottom of the shoe there are two pieces of rubber that are supposed to meet that dont i cannot tell if it goes all the way to the lining of the shoe or not very bad purchase on my part i will be returning them and i would recommend others not to buy for the same price you can get genuine leather shoes that will hold up much better over time
la talla que ofrece el vendedorno es lacrwal viene muy pequeo el tennis
no es posible he usado como veces los zapatos y ya se les est despegando la suela estoy muy decepcionada
was looking for a nike shoe and mistook the name jarlif as a style not a brand the fashion shoe came in a cute case but it wasnt what i wanted havent tried them on but probably if they dont fit or are not comfortable i will probably donate them dont let the air on the side fool you also they were delayed in arrival gave stars as average didnt look close at quality of construction because i had to leaveupdate right fit if you buy make sure to go a half size up word them to run errands were not comfortable for extended wear changed to stars very deceptive nike should sue but i guess since the word air cannot be trade marked this company can get away with it not a good way to build a brand
i did a targeted search for womens nike shoe black or something very close to that my search results included many nike shoes i chose this shoe when i received the delivery i realized it was not nike at all i suppose i just assume it was because of my query and the athletic shoe said air on the side perhaps i shouldve paid better attention in the future i will ill also be more aware of bait and switch at any rate i returned the shoes and received a refund i bought a pair of nikes elsewhere
nach nicht einmal monaten tragezeit lsen sich die nhte in wohlgefallen auf die klettverschlsse lsen sich ebenfalls auf der klett lst sich vom band ab wir mussten die schuhe bereits mehrere male nhen von einem adidas schuh erwarte ich mehr ich werde solche schuhe nicht mehr kaufen und kann von dem schuh nur abraten
these shoes are falling apart after two monthseither the quality of these shoes has gotten so bad after a few years or maybe these are counterfeit ive never seen a pair of shoes fall apart so fast the toes of the soles are peeling away and the frontside of the rubber sole has torn off completely next time ill buy my sauconys in a storemy kids old saucony shoes only started to wear out before he outgrew them but i paid for these and they didnt last barely two months of normal kid wear and tear hugely disappointed
very light i think its comfortable since my son loved it but feels a bit cheaply madeupdatethe velcro on both sides started detaching and actually holding the straps togetherthese shoes are very comfortable but really poor quality thet are literally fallimg apart
trotz schuhweit weit ist der schuh vorne viel zu schmal fr die zehen sie haben keinen platz deshalb zurck

i have never seen anything like this i tried them on the night before and took a few steps in the house approving of my new shoes i put them on for church and walked to my car parked in the driveway from there it was a few yards to sunday school from there it was up just one flight of steps to the sanctuary there i found a large chunk of foam in the floor at my pew it seemed to have a shape so i left it there maybe it was a part someone needed for something we went to a restaurant to eat and afterward i noticed the floorboard of the car was full of crumbles upon closer inspection huge chunks had fallen off the sole of my shoe i was just hoping it would hold together long enough for me make it into my house im glad i didnt wear these to work there would have been little foam crumb trails everywhere i went
unfortunately in my case these shoes made the balls of my feet burn after ten minutes of walking on a sidewalk i feel they would give me calluses there easily they are supposed to be comfortable shoes for diabetics so i dont understand why they felt so hard on the bottoms to me its almost like they left out the cushioning the shoe itself also seemed stiff i usually propets black washable walker theyre great but they dont come in beige or taupe or khaki which i am looking for
i have worn this brand for years and found the soles virtually indestructible therefore i was shocked when the sole of the left shoe cracked up to the bottom of the footbed the seller requested pictures which i provided and hasnt responded since extraordinarily disappointing
my wife is not rough on shoes but the bottom broke into two halves at the middle after not too long of use poor quality dont buy
the soles of this somewhat expensive shoe split across the ball of the foot yesterday one shoe completely the other is starting to split across the inner part of the sole i have been wearing them to work where i sit in front of a computer since september except for snowy months in winter and at the end of march i will have to throw them away a total waste of money i am not hard on shoes i have a pair of black new balance bought at sears five years ago that i still wear i understand the term planned obsolescence but this is ridiculous for a pair of shoes that cost propet get your act together
do not waste you money on this the material on the outer part of the shoe is flaking off after only uses
son muy cmodas y la talla es exacta yo uso y me estn bien lo nico malo es que la goma de la suela esta amarillenta y queda horribles las quieres devolver te soplan decepcin para el precio que tienenlas mustanas baratas y sin ese color fesimo
this shoe came recommended by various running sites which is why i made the investment i was just looking for a solid shoe to use for walkruns the shoe arrived and i was a little surprised by the construction i tried it on and it fit nicely i wore it out on a short walk with my wife not pushing myself then i took them out on a longer walkrun at a higher tempo and the heels of the shoes tore up my heels they were bloody and battered by the time i was done needless to say i was anything but impressed
this review is not a joke they are so bad for your feet its absurdamazon should stop selling thesethese shoes are for those who desire orthopedic surgery in the future they are so bad i have let others try them just to see how bad they are the feeling among my friends is youre better off walking barefoot unless theres glass on the floor i then showed them to a podiatrist who said they were worse for your feet than any shoes hed ever seen at payless please for your own good especially if you have arthritis do not buy these
alright i bought these because im cheap and tell you i wish i had saved my moneythey are bright brilliant white and light weight thats what appealed me to them you know gotta fit in at the gym but these will not help me in anyway working out the foam soul has zero traction i could see myself slipping on the tiniest of water droplets the liner pops out every time i take them off and they offer no support for jumping and squatting i wouldnt dare run in these eitherso learn from me and save your money and invest in a more quality product
well i bought these shoes because ive read been told how good brooks shoes are so i figured id give them a try the side of the sole digs into the side of my foot as soon as i put the shoe i felt it as my first pair of brooks i was disappointed maybe the kind i got had a bad cut or glue job the shoe also seemed a bit more narrow than what i was expecting either way i will be returning and probably wont try the brooks brand again
these did not work for me i have narrow feet usual size n but since reviewers said these ran narrow i decided to try them i ordered a half size up as recommended so medium they were very roomy and looked large on my feet they seemed comfortable enough at first tryon though so i decided to ignore my vanity and keep them yet after wearing for several days straight doing remodeling work on my house i found i had heel pain at night decided to return and order another style in n since the range does not come in that size if you normally wear a narrow shoe i do not recommend these i would also say you do not need to order a half size up these fit like a medium as listed
i absolutely love the style and look of these brooks unfortunately one on and tied they develop an uncomfortable crease in the toe area which makes for an unwearable shoe i tried different pairs and sizes of this same shoe and every pair creased in the toe area and rubbed my toe the same way see pictures i only wore them around my home for about minutes and the crease became too uncomfortable sadly have to return and will have to find another more comfortable model all other aspects of the shoe are great
i love brooks running shoes ive been using them for nearly years and ive loved every pair i bought sadly this pair doesnt sit straight on one of my feet the left shoe slips outward while walkingrunning ive never had that issue with a shoe i walk for work and on my first day put miles on this shoe trying to right it as i went the whole day its as if the cushion on the bottom was displaced slightly or is wonky like a pillow youve put in the dryer i wish i could return them since i paid their okay for driving which i also do for work so i keep them handy for that but im disappointed in brooks at this point
the left shoe has a lot of dried glue on the tongue and near two of the eyelets i also sized up size and these are still snug
nach nicht einmal monat lst sich der schuh auf ganz schlechte qualitt absolut nicht zu empfehlen egal zu welchem preis aber so darf eine qualitt nicht sein ich bin sehr enttuscht
schuhe nur geffnet und berhrt danach sofort aus der wohnung entfernt und minutenlang die hnde gewaschendennoch stark an der haut anhaftender geruchextrem starker chemiegeruch unhaltbar derartige artikel fr kinder anzubieten
scarpe assolutamente non originali fanno puzzare i piedi al bambino perch fatte di materiale davvero scadente
the insole had zero support after a few walks my feet hurt so bad i couldnt keep using the shoe i bought and put in a new insert and the band over the top of the shoe digs in so bad it is impossible to wear unless you want a shoe with zero support go with something else my husband also bought this brand of shoes and his had actual support in the shoe not sure why the women shoe is more poorly supported a huge waste of money
i was hoping for good arch support and these do not have much my feet were hurting after just a couple of miles because of this and its probably not ok to return them since theyve already been worn outdoors other than they they are nice shoes i feel very stable in them and they run close to true to size i bought size or maybe just a tad bit on the small side
the shoe appears well constructed and has good support however it was so tight that it hurt to put it on no matter how much i loosened the laces i hard marks on my feet when i took them off after a few hours of wear i bought the same size i always wear and have never needed a wide width shoe these are going back
i have loved merrell shoes for decades i discovered them after the first time i had plantar fasciitis and i own all types which i enjoy during all seasons of the year i received this pair of hiking shoes on august after wearing them for less than a half a dozen times the shoelace aglet was either missing or came off this of course will eventually mean the shoelace will no longer be useful or work properly amazon makes returning items easy but nonetheless it is still a pain to return the shoes and i will be without good hiking shoes until i get new ones i certainly expect more from merrell products going forward if this is reflective of the quality of merrells products i will not be purchasing any more
el producto es de muy mala calidad no son asimtricos las costuras estan mal hechas los cortes y las proporciones cuando mi hijo se las puso una se iba totalmente de lado por lo ms confeccionadas y cocidas que estanno las recomiendo
my son picked these out because he looooves dinosaurs and well how cute but literally minutes after they were unboxed one of the dang horns fell off literally brand new and theyre broken my year old is super upset as am i but i have to find something to send them back on my own and print out a damn return label which is bs because everything is closed so i cant ship it back that easily
my daughter is years and is not rough with shoes at all she wore her new koala slippers on christmas and within a few hours one of the puff ears fell off then not even days later another ear came up so all the stuffing is exposed im trying to convince my daughter to return them they are completely sold out of her size now to try another pair although reading other reviews this seems to be a problem but she really loves the look of them so we will probably just keep them and try to glue it back together i cannot recommend these slippers to anyone unless you want your child upset that they fall apart immediately dearfoam has lost me as a customer how could they sells such a junky product for and get away with it
i had a previous pair of these years ago that i loved this pair were very flimsy and felt extremely cheap
they fit as expected i really like the color and stylevery disappointed of these shoes as i was expecting them to last a lot longeronly months of using them and they are already starting to get a hole on the mesh as you can see in the pictures i uploadednot what you are expecting for shoes designed for crossfitthe mesh material seems is not able to be made for some intermediate workoutsdo not waste your money on shoes that you will not be able to get not even a quarter of it supposedly lasting life
an earlier model of this shoe were my favorite pair of gym shoes ever i was super sad to receive these much cheaper materials and not the same feel toe box was narrower and i could tell they were going to fall apart quickly they were sadly an instant return
these are super cute and appear well made however im a true but read the other reviews and ordered the just in case not only are the shoes too small but i legitimately cannot even get my foot inside them these are labelled but they are clearly no bigger than a maybe even a if you must buy these order at least a size up if not more but honestly i would not recommend buying them at all because if they cant get something as simple as the shoe size right i would be surprised if the actual construction of the shoe held up
these shoes are very comfortable but just after a few days i started noticing the green color fading off and the white cloth underneath coming through which made the shoes very spotted and looking very odd more and more keeps fading off each day i am very disappointed especially because they are not inexpensive shoes
i wanted to love these soooo bad because they are so stinking cute but as hard as i tried they just were not comfortable to me standing in them for minutes and my feet would just hurt the footbed was too hard i even bought a wonderfully thin soft memory foam insert so the shoe didnt fit too tight and i ended up keeping the insoles because i loved them but i found no relief i had such high hopes for these from the amazing reviews but i had to send them back they were true to fit they werent narrow and i have wide feet so that says a lot and the length was fine they were just hard and made my feet sore but many other people i know love them hope you have luck with them
las deportivas son muy bonitas lo malo que me mandaron un sapato media talla menos y la otra normal y tube que pagar el envo de la devolucin solo espero que me devuelvan el dinero
no recomiendo para nada muy bonitas pero malsima calidad para ser la marca que es me siento estafada
este proveedor mando mal los tenis que yo pedi y no conforme con eso ahora que quiero volver a pedirlos pasaron dias les aumento en un su valor creo que por eso mando mal los tenis por que se equivoco en el precio y me obligo a que los devolviera para no perderle
i wish i could give stars fit and comfort were fine i have only had these shoes for months and they are worn out for i got of comfort and durability i had a pair of cheapos from payless that lasted months for what these cost one would expect a lot more of a life span absolutely horrible complete waste of money
la scatola originale la scarpa e dura non morbida come dovrebbe o preferito fare un reso uso adidas e le conosco bene sono morbide e confortevoli questa scarpa ha una suola dura per niente confortevole anche se la deve usare un bambino anche se al piede del mio bambino calza piccola
the only thing i liked about these shoes was the color for slip on shoes they were a struggle to get on the soles were the kind you find on inexpesive shoes i was expecting a lot of cushion but it has a very thin cushion
i didnt receive the correct shoe
im erstem moment schn und bequem aber schon nach dem ersten tag bei der arbeit war klar dass die schuhe weder fr fuwege noch zum stehen geeignet sindgekauft am primeday im juni und wochen spter ist das memoryfoam fubett durch und die sohle ist gebrochenich bin echt enttuscht
those shoes are cute and comfortable however there is definitely an issue with the zippers they are often stuck and it takes time and patience to make them go up or down properly very frustrating im not sure if both zippers on the shoes are mean to be functional or decorative but you need to unzipp at least one per shoe to put your foot in and remove the shoes as well better not be in a rush when putting them on bummer because otherwise i was happy with the comfort the fit and design 
cute but not the best quality not super comfortable and after having them for a month the sole wore out at the bottom and is broken bad quality ive only worn them maybe times
disappointed in the quality of the boots they look cheaply madereturned them and waiting for the refund
same thing happened to me after i wore them three times i lost maybe a dozen orange grips and i cannot have a replacement since they are out of stock never had a problem with merrellknock off

my regular size is a in shoes i ordered an and they were still too big i returned them but they didnt have a sz 
the are way too wide and dont look as nice in person as they do in the picture i dunno what ima do with them
this shoe is soooo big style is cute just soooo big it felt like more then one shoe size big
bin unzufrieden
see dangeorge review it is accurate plus after days of wearing the reebok printed label started wear off the sole of the shoe is so thin you can feel a pebble very unhappy with the supplier and with amazon for promoting this garbage and now i am out almost thank you amazonfollowup went to the reebok outlook mall store they told me this shoe model is not one of theirs shoesi tried to make them work for a week they were so uncomfortable to wear i bought insoles to try to make them comfortable didnt workafter day of wearing the shoes the reebok logo printd inside the shoe was wearing awayoh while i was at the reebok store i purchased a great pair of reeboks very very comfortable and for only 
bought these in january in april the leather on the right shoe started to bubble in may the left shoe outer seam ripped im not doing any real activity in these just walking i think around k steps a day this isnt the quality i remember from reebok
el producto es de piel sinttica por lo que carece de la calidad esperada por favor no lo publiquen as porque engaan al cliente y lo hacen dudar o convencerse de que la prxima compra volver a ser engaado
 
the shoe is stiff and hard and ran a bit on the small side for me it squeezed my feet together and after a few hours my feet was hurting
i am very disappointed i had heard how great clarks were and was excited to get these at such a bargain i now know why they were on clearance i wore this shoe around the house for a short time and they felt ok but wow towards the end of my work day my feet started killing me they hurt on both sides as well as across the top sending back asap

liebe leserwir haben die schuhe fr unseren sohn gekauft weil er unbedingt grne bergschuhe haben wollte und da ist die auswahl dann doch nicht so gro auf den ersten onlineblick hat die qualitt fr den angebotenen preis gepasst aber auf der ersten wanderung wo es uns eingeregnet hat und der sohnemann zuhause die schuhe ausgezogen hat waren sie voll von rosarotem pappmach als wir die sohle zum trocknen herausgenommen haben mussten wir feststellen dass in den spritzgusssohlen die quaderfrmigen zwischenrume mit pappmach gefllt waren welches sich bei der eingedrungenen nsse aufgelst hatte und sich im ganzen schuh verteilt hatte keine dmpfung kein fubett nichts auer nassem pappmach also komplett wertlos und schade ums geld mal schauen wie sich der verkufer beim after sales service verhlt um zumindest den einen stern sich zu verdienen den man geben muss oder eventuell bei ordentlicher rckabwicklung einen zweiten dazuverdient
zunchst einmal das gute am schuh er passt wie angegeben und sitzt recht gutnun leider zu negativen unter der einlegesohle befindet sich nur etwas pappe die sich sehr schnell auflst und die sohle darunter preis gibt diese tritt sich dann recht schnell durch und das bereits nach wochen die angedeutete gummierung auen ist nur hauchdnn und fr kinder nicht geeignet da die schuhe sich extrem schnell abnutzen nach wochen nur noch ein fall fr den mll da unser kind sich sonst die fe kaputt macht und das obwohl die schuhe nur im wechsel getragen wurden
habe die schuhe fr meine jhrige tochter gekauft ende mai bestellt versand wie von amazon gewhnt problemlos aber qualitativ bin ich enttuschtam die schuhe bekommen und nun mitte august sind sie total kaputt vorne offen und total ausgelatschtmeine tochter hat auch noch andere schuhe sprich sie wurden nicht jeden tag getragenich erwarte von outdoor schuhen defenitiv mehr
vorab unser sohn liebt die schuhe da man sie zuziehen kann und es seine ersten ohne klettverschluss sind er kann noch keine schuhe binden findet sich selbst aber zu gro fr klettverschlsseich bin nicht ganz so begeistert wir haben die schuhe jeden tag fr den kindergarten die vorschule an und nach wochen lsen sie sich nun leider auf sie lassen sich recht gut reinigen so dass sie auch nach einem tag im sandkasten wieder passabel aussehenganz dumm aber finde ich die sohle die innensohle aus stoff kann man raus nehmen sie ist sehr dnn und lapprig drunter befindet sich eine sohle aus pappe die ist fest im schuh mein sohn schwitzt an den fen in diesen schuhen umso mehr denn atmungsaktiv sind sie beileibe nicht und die pappe wellt sich nun im schuhdaher kann das laufen in den schuhen nicht bequem sein er mag sie nur wegen der optik zumindest gehe ich davon ausich bin ganz froh dass sie sich nun auflsen und ich andere kaufen kann denn mit solcher schnrung gibt es auch andere marken
beim ersten anprobieren waren wir begeistert die schuhe passten mein sohn machte vor freude fast purzelbume sie waren so bequem und der grip grandiosdann stand die erste wanderung mit den neuen tretern an ich wunderte mich nach kilometern war er nur noch am quengeln weil die fe weh taten wir wandern viel und gerne das war uncharakteristischbei unserer groen pause am mittag nahm ich die einlegsohle heraus damit die vollgeschwitzten schuhe besser trocknen und fand sofort die ursache fr die schmerzen die schuhe sind offensichtlich mit pappe ausgepolstert diese hat sich im laufe der wanderung so komprimiert dass die im bild sichtbaren rillen durchgedrckt sind dass das beim laufen wehtut ist klarich hoffe bei der erstattung klappt alles das geht nmlich gar nicht als wander oder wie beschrieben gar trekkingschuh vllig unbrauchbar und das auch noch fr einen preis fr den man in kindergren auch vernnftige trekkingschuhe bekommt
diese schuhe als trekkingschuhe fr kinder anzubieten ist unverschmtnach wenigen wochen tragen lst sich die untere pappinnensohle komplett auf und zerbrselt in alle bestandteile siehe auch fotos von den anderen kommentatoren hier noch dazu kommt dass vom fu ausgehende feuchtigkeit was fe nunmal mitunter so an sich haben sammelt sich hervorragend zwischen den beiden sohlen das fhrt dazu dass man die schuhe nicht mehr tragen kann da die zweite innensohle viel zu dnn ist und alles durchdrcktdie schuhe haben gekostet und sind nach einigen wochen nicht mehr tragbar ich wrde sie auf keinen fall wieder kaufen
der schuh wurde nur x mal sonntags fr den sport von einem jhrigen getragen danach reif fr die mlltonnedazu kommt noch dass einmal der schuh in dieser zeit auch getauscht wurde material ist nicht zu empfehlen optisch ein sehr schner schuh in unseren augen
nichtmal stern wertich habe wirklich in jahren die ich meinem sohn schuhe kaufe noch niemals solch einen schlechten schuh besessennach gerade einmal woche riss bereits die klettlasche am gummizipper ab da dachte ich noch okey kind hat blde dran gezogennach wochen waren die sohlen schon stark abgelaufen und vorne die schuhkappen massiv abgeschubbt und ich fragte meinen sohn was er denn neuerdings beim laufen so treibenachdem jetzt aber nach wochen der ganze schuh auseinander fllt lcher in die sohle gelaufen sind und ich gedacht habe ich fall vom stuhl als ich die einlegesohle herausgenommen habe muss ich meinem unmut doch mal luft machen dieser schuh hat die bezeichnung trekkingschuh in keinster weise verdient und nichtmal schuhe aus bekannten discountern haben so eine unterirdisch schlechte qualitt wie dieser schuh es grenzt schon an frechheit solch einen schuh in den verkauf zu geben und auch noch als kinderschuh geschenkt ist noch zu teuer
die schuhe sehen schn und gut verarbeitet aus allerdings ist beim ersten mal tragen eine der schlaufen kaputt gewesen in die das gummischuhband gefdelt ist ich glaube nicht dass die schlaufe ausgerissen ist sondern dass sie eher nicht mit genht worden ist oder zu knapp abgeschnitten selbst reparieren wre hier nicht mglich gewesen amazon hat sich allerdings vorbildlich in bezug auf die gewhrleistung gezeigt und somit konnten wir die schuhe zurckgeben und andere bestellenvon der passform her waren sie ziemlich eng und relativ steif keine ahnung ob sich das nach lngerem tragen legt
nachdem mein eigener schuh nach monaten gebrochen war ist der schuh fr meine frau auch defektdh er ist nun undichtleider etwas schwierig auf den bildern zu sehendie sohle ist ohne fehler und die passform spitze und daher ist es extrem schade um den schuhwie kann so eine miese qualitt durch die qualittssicherung kommen
das obermaterial ist nicht wirklich haltbar bei beiden schuhen ist auf beiden seiten das material gebrochen und nun ist der schuh natrlich undicht gtx hilft dann auch nicht mehr weiteres ist besonders bedauerlich da die sonstigen eigenschaft wie passform tragekomfort hervorragend sind
awful they hurt my feet i thought once they were broken in they would feel better but nothing has changed others have tried them agree that they kill the feet
im a size ten and bought size eleven but my toes were curled so much there was no way i could wear them great looking shoe otherwise
the media could not be loaded the shoes came in used black diamond you got to be kidding me returning item
ich habe mir den schuh im juni gekauftjetzt ende september fngt der schuh an sich an der seite aufzulsenich habe den schuh x die woche an und das auf noralem rasenmann knnte ja davon ausgehen dass er wenigstens monate halten wrdeich wrde gerne wissen wie lange der schuh bei fterem gebrauch hlt wochendanke aber nein dankegre
i was very happy about these shoes at firstuntil the inside seam split after a few days of trying them out indoors
the ms on the side of the shoe is not leather but almost felt and it ripped when i tied the shoe
i have a high arch so getting these on is a task once on they hurt my arches even after id taken them off i wish this was not a problem cuz they are nice shoes just a word of warning to high arch people not gonna be good
could not fit my foot into the shoe this shoe might be good for you if you have a very narrow foot and ankle the shoe tongue is attached all the way up the sides so you cant adjust the fit if that makes sense and you have to pay for return shipping which is my fault bc i didnt read the fine print
got these for cheap and i see why they are unwearable
these shoes woul be comfortable but the fit is awkwardly small they are too short in length and narrow in width but still look wide and bulky i have a normal to narrow foot width and always wear a size 
they are kind of like the cheap made in china shoes you would find at the dollar store you know made for people with square feet no support and they only feel good if tied very tight i cant imagine these are actually adidas shoes
fake adidas glue on the sides box was all crushed if it was real adidas they would provide an extra pair of laces they are really cheap good looking but cheap and fake
i never write reviews but thought this was worth cautioning i ordered a size as we had bought a size in the store and the shoe didnt have much room to grow the store was sold out and this is the only place i have found a in the blue color you can see in the pictures a comparison of the sole of the new shoe from the store vs the shoe i bought here the soles of the shoe bought here are filthy and the inside of the shoe has hair and some balled lint from obvious wear these will be returned as i thought i was purchasing a new pair of shoesalso for sizing reference i would definitely size up a half to full size for your kids
a very narrow fit i was surprised because i had never been disappointed with an adidas shoe purchase for my son i wonder if the narrow sizing it is due to the unisex make of the shoe
i am very upset with this company i had to spend to ship my return back to them and i also find out im going to be charged a restock fee for the price of the shoes i didnt expect to have to pay return shipping at all by the time i am through i will have spent almost half the cost of the shoes just to send them back i have never had a company double charge me like this to even think about reading the return policy obviously i will in the future but i think its wrong for this company to have such a high restock fee and charge for return shipping for a product that cost this is ridiculous am very very upset about this and will never order from them again the shoe is terrible quality and the material is harsh and uncomfortable you can see the glue along the fabric where it meets the sole very upset
one of the shoes showed that it had been worn for more than just to try on they also have the hardest soles it honestly sounded like i was walking around my house in high heels not comfortable at all i am so disappointed because these are so cute but in my opinion these shoes are definately not worth the money sent back
these are cute but just not comfortable they also run very large and wide i am a size and they fit more like a theyre very hard and the soles are not comfortable labeling them as a running shoe is misleading these would probably hurt my feet walking around town all day so being labeled a running shoe is inaccurate i chose to return also you must pay to return shipping there is a restocking fee disappointed
the shoe is really cute which drew me in however the sole is incredibly hard and the shoe is too stiff to get on even though the size ended up being too big what i strongly hated about this is the seller not only makes you pay for return shipping not unheard of but there is also a restocking fee buy at your own risk
poco resistenti purtroppo dopo settimana mia figlia le ha gia consumate secondo me non sono originali non possibile
im a type diabetic as i age ive found it difficult to buy comfortable shoes i had high hopes for these until i tried them on there is virtually no padding in them and arch support is inferior for the price i expected much more theyre also huge my feet rattled around inside even when i used my orthotics quality is not as good as id expected
this is the nd time that i have written about problems with this shoe the first time was because the velcro straps on my left shoe were uneven so i wrote to the dr comfort company and never received a reply from them at all great customer servicenow the sole on my left shoe has come unglued and is not safe to walk with because the rubber on the sole keeps rolling up when walkingwhich is very dangerous for me great workmanship i belong to a stroke club with about members and i will definitely tell them to steer clear of the dr comfort shoes because they are a ripoff that did not last months without falling apart
these were great for several months but recently my husband was driving our truck hauling our ft th wheel trailerer and the shoes had stretched so much that his shoe fell off while driving and got stuck under the brake pedal nearly causing a very serious accident thankfully we have a hand trailer brake he was able to use we tried tightening these with the velcro as far as possible but the shoe still slipped off is months the average length of use for wear if so these are very expensive for the length we have had them
shoes seem excellent quality sturdy and supportive and well made unfortunately the width runs a bit small a small block inserted in the toe showed the width just over inch narrower than other brands my toes were painfully cramped and walking was uncomfortable the issue was only with the toe otherwise the shoe seemed comfortable if toe width is important this is probably not your best choice if that is not a major issue however this seems to be an excellent option unfortunately i returned mine
ok so ive run in the wave creations for years and this update is very disappointing first off its much heavier than previous models maybe that means more cushioning and can be used for longer runs idk i dont feel it has the same arch support and it bothers my shins slightly the toe box is smaller and it feels like my toe bang up against the medial side of the shoe this could be the shoe just runs smaller and i need a bigger size either way my feet are extremely narrow so i usually never have a problem with a narrow toe box it does not have a tongue which i actually love it slides on so easily and feels like it fits great but then i start running i thought it would the same as my other mizunos but im frustrated i may have to find myself a new running shoe overall im going to give it another week and see if i can break it in a bit although i have never needed to do this with previous versions
first of all im a size in almost every normally sized shoesneakersandal etc the sizing of this sneaker and another mizuno style of running shoe that i tried on instore is completely wonky i started by ordering my regular size and it was so small and painful so then ordered a and then a and finally an before i could put them on my feet without my toes getting smushed up at the front unfortunately in the size that fit me the best the arch support of the sneaker was positioned in the wrong place so it was really bothersome and uncomfortable to wear also the material by my ankles rubbed on the positive side i can say that the cushioning and the integrated tongue were nicei bought and returned pairs of the same style of sneaker to amazon and have nothing to show for it but a complete lack of confidence in mizuno sneakers im going to try a different brand wish me luck
im a huge mizuno fan they have been my choice in running shoe for years but these are super disappointing i am a in regular shoes but always order an or in mizuno since they tend to run small bought an and they dont fit at all the heel padding pushes your foot so far forward your toe is crammed at the front of the toe box the plastic pieces that the laces attach to are rigid so if you try to tighten the laces to keep your foot back they push into the sides of your foot giving you blisters this is more than a size issue its an overall fit issue unfortunately i missed the return window so have tried to make these work but there is just no way very disappointed
i wear a mizuno at least i have for the last years i ordered the creation waveknit in a size they were too small so i sent them back and ordered a size i thought it was just mebecause how could it possibly be the shoeand thought if i sucked it up put on thicker socks and changed up the lacing that they would work nope it looks like im wearing clown shoes like they really look that ridiculous these things actually slip off and because i tried to make it work like an abusive relationship i cant send them backso if youre looking for a pair of womens creation waveknit running shoes in a size i have a friend who can cut you a deal
i wanted so badly to love these shoes ive owned several pair of mizunos in the past and wore them until they were practically falling apart these are narrow and small my foot felt squeezed in despite being the correct size i walked around my carpeted home for a few hours when i took the shoes off it was a relief had to return them 
this was my th pair of mizuno wave shoes this style of knit shoe is sooooo uncomfortable that i can only wear then a few hours before my feet start to ache
incredibly uncomfortable as the back of the shoe is high and causing excruciating pain on the back of my foot nice style and design
great shoe but plan for them to be too dirty to wear after one day unless you can be sure they arent being worn outside they get dirty fast also were a bit snug compared to the same size in other sneakers usually love puma but these ones not so much

no criss cross straps as in photo wanted that unique look came in just one regular strap across center
einmal getragen und farbe ab schlechtes qualit
was excited to get these ugg flipflops for my brother unfortunately i didnt look at them until the day i gave them to him they were worn rocks in the treead and water stain on the leather soles sighs should have known something was awry when the shoes came in a plain box instead an ugg box be careful of purchasing shoes on amazon could be used
the sole fit my foot exactly so i know i got the right side but there is a massive gap between the top of my foot and the bottom of the upper thong part of the shoe more than a half inch of a gap is way too much i have tons of ugg products that i love but this was a huge disappointment maybe australians just have ridiculously thick feet or something
the straps are a bit loose as i expect them to loosen up as they break so im returning them im an and think the would have been better then the the quality looks good but they still werent for me
the inside of the shoes is very rough not finished properlyo should really return it but cannot be bothered i bought the same style yr ago and wanted to replace itbut very disappointedafter takingvso long to arrive please pass on the message sole soft but the uppers very roughmight end up giving me blisterswill see very very disappointed 
ive been airing out these shoes for over a month and the chemical stink of them is still overwhelming i discarded the box so i assume im stuck with them otherwise they are cute and comfortable but they werent cheap enough to have to contend with this horrible manufacturing odor
i purchased these sneakers after much research new balance sells them as a fantastic walking shoe the reviews rated this model with to stars and lots of positive feedback my intention was to get something comfortable to wear on a future trip to germany where we expected to do a lot of walking i thought i had finally found what i was looking forbut unfortunately they are not even close to comfortable at first i thought that i had to break them in so i was patient and kept wearing them for a mile walk about times since i purchased them conclusion is that i cannot possibility consider wearing them after about mile the balls of my feet ache and i cant wait to take them off
shoe fits correct but she has holes in both shoes in three months have several other new balance running shoes no problems years of use these three months of use and the holes in the fabric as if someone was using a drill to make them i wish i could get a line to nb and find out what went wrong with this style of shoe
extremely lightweight with zero support they actually cause probation in the childs foot rather then ecoutage proper foot positioning orthotics will not fit and the soles are as tin as two pieces of paper glued together another wasted pair of kid sneakers
compared to size w athletic shoe in another nb style that we already had this shoe in size w was considerably shorter and narrower it shouldnt even be considered wide according to shoe label size was correct i have depended on new balance for wide shoes disappointing
the sizing of these is way off i listened to the reviews and ordered a whole size larger than normal i wear a lot of nb shoes of this same style and they were right i needed a whole size larger in length but they were very narrow i returned them and ordered the same thing in a wide only to find that this shoe was not only wider but much longer also so i guess you should order a half size larger and wide in order to get a proper fit i give up i wouldnt recommend ordering these online unless you know for a fact what size is appropriate try these on first if at all possible
i purchased these shoes a little under weeks ago and am not impressed with the durability of the stitching on them i skate maybe an hour every other day but i do not do any crazy tricks an ollie and kickflip if im feeling it and this is just from a small time frame of wearing them my previous vans half cabs lasted months i had heard good things about new balance for skating but am not impressed with them at all they are also not comfortable in the slightest even after wearing them in a good bit maybe i got a bad batch but if not do better new balance
i bought my original fit that i buy for all shoes and these were nowhere near the size i couldnt even get the shoes on over my toes i got refund so no harm no foul
the fit is fine the shoe is way too squeaky when you walk unless you are on carpet this is a really unpleasant shoe
these sneakers are really cute looking and pretty comfortable for someone on their feet for hours a day i am disappointed in the quality though as the sole is peeling off the bottom already with only months of wear wearing them days a week
a bit more bubble gum pink than i normally like
para ser de la marca arena un desengao porque ya estn deformadas la suela y horma del pie
nicht gut kann ich nicht tragen
wide width size is not very roomy shoe is very snug i do not recommend for kids with wide feet
the shoes are too hard to walk on they dont even bent so i dont understand how is comfortable to run on them not a good choice for a toddler
i really wanted to like these shoes but in the end i dont feel like they are safe i made the screws as tight as possible but there was still a good bit of slide or wiggle from left to right on the petal making it feel unsafe i also found the tongue to be too long and the sharp edge of the material pressed into the top of my ankle lastly the screws it comes with are a jokethey have no gripbut that may not be a problem if your clips come with their own screws
the shoes fit very tight they are not best suited for wider feet even with adjusting the tightness of the laces overall not the best quality
trs due par la marquedcrites comme des baskets de running alors quelles ont dj la gomme de la semelle arrire extrieure mange par le bitume en seulement footings de kmle prix hors les est pourtant assez lev premire et dernire exprience pour cette marque prochain achat je retourne chez acics
started out very supportive but still comfortable only stayed waterproof for about two weeks then they started tearing on the sides of both shoes in the same spot after months i think its just a poor design for definitely spend your money elsewhere i love and swear by my other merrels but these are a total miss soles still look great and love the color and styling just wish they would last longer
update april original review below by november i stopped wearing these shoes regularly because they were just too hot to wear comfortably for long periods i cannot recommend these shoes because they just become too hot the heat results in excessive sweating and the shoes smell bad as a result find another pair reducing review to two starsoriginal reviewi ordered these merrell mens moab fst waterproof hiking shoes to replace a set of keen hiking shoes that i had worn out the keens are excellent shoes and very comfortable but they tend to get extensive wear on the soles particularly for me the heels wear out within mos this review is my initial impression and i will update if anything changesfit the shoes fit as expected they seem a bit tighter than the keen equivalent but are as expected for the sizecomfort these waterproof shoes get hot and are hotter than the keen equivalent waterproof shoe the foot bed is definitely not as good as the keen probably the most notable differencewaterproof so far so good i had to wade into shallow water and my feet were dry until the water got deep enough to overtop the shoeoverall quality i have high hopes that the heel on this shoe will not wear as quickly quality of the shoes seems very highi rate these shoes as stars out of with the subtraction coming for the less comfortable foot bed than the competition and the lessened breathability resulting in more heat in the foot i cant help but feel that if the shoe had a breathable but waterproof fabric the shoes would feel cooler and more comfortable for extended wear
i purchased these months ago and was very excited to see a pair of vegan waterproof pair of merrels however was very disappointed that theses didnt seem to be waterproof more water resistant also the the back started to get worn out very quickly im an avid hiker and dont really take it easy on my hiking shoes tbh so i reccomend another pair of you are looking for a sturdy waterproof pair of hiking shoes
the shoes are very comfortable and maintain traction on dry and wet surfaces but i definitely would not call these waterproof the first time i was walking through the rain and wet grass water my socks and feet got very wet and two days later the shoes still have not completely dried for that reason im giving this shoe stars
i returned the boots because the quality was not as depicted the materials and the finishes were of lower quality than expected and a huge disappointment to me when i receive them additionally the boots were very uncomfortable when i tried them on seller doesnt want to refund me
was excited to get these boots as a gift for my boyfriend as soon as they where delivered i opened the box to look at them and noticed they are damaged im not satisfied as they are a gift i am supposed to be giving him tomorrow for the cost i expect better quality not to mention now im giftless will return
this is not at all as described its not textured its smooth and the designs do not show very much either terrible quality for the price

our family loves dcs but these fell apart super quick my son pulled on a loose string and the whole sole on one shoe unraveled and came apart bummer
this does not appear to be genuine adidas theres so many loose threads the nubuck trim is kinda cheap feeling the inside is very hard the outside feels like umbrella materialthe sides dont have any padding of any kind they look nice from afar but up close its obvious they are fake
so the shoes look nice and all but im positive they are made out of plastic to the point where i have marks around my ankles from the shoes cutting into them they did not come with adidas tags or an adidas box it just looks like illegal knockoffs had to purchase separate insoles for them i need them for work but i doubt they will last longer than a month or two so unfortunate
they are thick and hotruns true to size

diese schuhe passten unserem sohnemann sofort und nichts drckte wir hatten die schuhe eine woche in gebrauch und haben sie dann zurck geschickt da er jeden tag feuchte oder nasse fe hatte an tagen dieser woche hatte er nasse fe von nur durch nasse wiese oder ber nasse wege laufen und dass trotz der vor benutzung empfohlenen imprgniereneinzige plus ist dass die schuhe warm gehalten haben und wirklich flexibel sindwir haben aber dann schuhe einer anderen marke bestellt die zustzlich auch wasserdicht sind 
well we liked those shoes until my daughter went out to the snow yesterday unfortunately her feet got soaked and the shoes arent dried out a day later so pretty disappointed since i have bought them for those reasons to be waterproof and snow proof
el exterior del zapato ya me haca presagiar que haba sido usado pero la plantilla interior me lo confirm realmente decepcionante que te vendan un producto usado lgicamente lo he devuelto
wish i could still return missed the window way too small for the size
i often order by amazon shoes which is like eu sizesbut now you send me a shoes which is and of course it is too small for me does not fit to me
four months regular walking use and there is already a hole on the top part of the shoe the piece delivered could have been factory reject sold by the seller
es wird mit dem gtx modell geworben es kommt allerdings das ganz normale modell an ging darum sofort zurck
no tiene nada que ver en comodidad y confort con las crocs originales
they fit perfectly but felt cheap and sounded like a crunching plastic bag for that amount of money you could at least await some decent quality and not the cheap crap that feels like counterfeit products
brand new looks like someone tried them on and spilled their coffee on the left sneaker then returned them where at the customer service center they were lackadaisically inspected before being reclaimed as new and entered back into the stock for a lucky customer like myself to reap all the benefits of their insouciance
die sohle der schuhe ist viel zu hart ich wei nicht wer solche kinderschuhe herstellt ich habe sie kein bisschen gebogen bekommen das design an sich ist schn
these shoes were really large ive worn sketchers for years but the box stated stretchy fit and was not consistent with my other sketchers which were basically the same style stretch fit needs to be included in the description so that i can avoid them in the future
they sewed the damn shoe laces into the back of the shoe now in order to switch to the type of laces i prefer i have to cut the original laces so that i can put the ones i like in ill wait for a bit before i do that but this is not starting off wellwhat even worse is they didnt even make the laces even before sewing the lace into the back end of the shoe so on one foot the lace is a solid inch longer on one side i can get past this for a comfortable shoe but its a severe annoyance that when i do replace the laces that i cannot run them the way they were intended to gostupid move on the manufacturers part they got stars so far because they fit like they are supposed to but still really annoyed about the laces being sown in
ive had these shoes before and i loved the comfort and fit but this model has some serious problems firstly the shoe has a serious design flaw the laces are sewn in place and not replaceable the laces wrap all the way around the heel as a real moccasin would but they are sewn in at the heel if your lace wears out as mine did the shoe is worthless the first time this happened new balance was kind enough to replace the shoe the second time the shoe was pretty well worn out so i just bought a new pair thats when i discovered the second problem after only wearing the shoe a week a week the leather ripped out along the stitching near the base of the tongue on the left shoe ok no problem i returned the shoe to amazon and got another pair the nd pair popped a stitch at the same place on the right shoe before i got the shoe on my foot just opening up the shoe caused a tear now i have to return the second pair too this time for a refundit looks like nb is having some manufacturing problems you can see how some stitching is off a tiny fraction actually weakening the leather by crossing the prepunched holes where pieces are stitched together so as much as i liked this shoe when i first bought it several years ago i wont be buying it again anytime shoe
my shoes came in with stains on them and scratches along the bottom of the shoe
it was dirty and a different color i return it
e da sottolineare che inadeguato per bimbo di mesi ma anche po grande altissimo e il bambino si storce la caviglia
soy muy fan de las superga y mis hijos siempre las llevan muy a gusto sin embargo estas tienen una plataforma de cm que no es apta para nios pequeos mi hijo no poda caminar pareca que llevara zancos
i was hoping these would be a shoe for standing and walking on concrete my daily walk and work routine ughh the fit is strange the size is too small but the worst part is the inside construction cheap the side curl in on themselves and are a pain to even work with to put on skip it not worth the price
ce ne sont pas mes premires new balance habituellement je suis trs satisfaite par contre dans cet achat jai command du large il est crit large sur la bote et dans les souliers et pourtant cette fois trop troite bizarre jai t rembours sans problme mais je suis due
wow new balance way to take a great shoe and completely ruin it i was willing to overlook the awful color but the design is even worse the fabric upper will fall apart in no time there is a tight seam right over the widest part of the foot and will you stop already with flat laces i bought in two colors and will be returning both of them last years model was just fine why do you feel the need to reinvent the wheel every year as a longtime devotee and proponent of the minimus this is making me regret recommending it to my personal training clients and will definitely send me out on the search for a new shoe thanks for nothing
the foam is weird and squishy and uncomfortable
i was so excited about these shoes but i cannot wear these my foot will not slide in at all i also missed the return date
when i saw these online it says theyre women shoes but when they was sent to me the box says unisex so they was way to large very misleading
my foot doctor told me that if it is easy to bend a shoe dont wear it this shoe is easy to bend with your hands soft soles i have worn them over the past few months and am experiencing heel pain and lower back pain one week ago i remembered what to look for and switched shoes and am already feeling better i can not recommend these shoes for walking let alone running if you do that i dont i do own other reeboks which are perfectly fine it is this particular model that is not good for me
the media could not be loaded this product came to me damaged worn dirty and smelly not advertised as shown literally a scam and will be reporting disgusted do not purchase these you will be disappointed
the sneakers are really nice the colors and everything however the sizing is super super big i ordered a size and it was so big that i had to return it and order a and the sixth was still a halfsize big if anyone orders the sneaker they have to order a size down or size of the house down
the product was much too large for my wife she normally wears a size but these seemed to be perhaps a mans size way too long they have been returned

la qualit est l malheureusement llastique comprime le pied de la fille au niveau du coup de pied dommage
nuevo a estrenar sandalias bonitas pero amazon las entrega sin caja al menos enmi caso no se me informa de nada y llegan en la simple bolsa de plstico de reparto de amazon la verdad q muy mal en ese aspecto porque son para regalar y as parecen falsas aunque no lo son
leider hlt der schuh nicht was er verspricht nach mal tragen war der schuh klitschnass innen und berhauptnicht wasserdicht da erwarte ich von euro schuhen was anderes auch bei matschwettergleichzeitig zerstrt der untere klettverschluss das material des stiefels da dieser direkt aufliegtdie schuhe werde ich zurck schicken
my girls cant even wear them they are a size too small
we got these may for our son and they have already came right apart i would like to return but missed the window by a few days 
i wish i had read others reviews before buying but since my son already owned and loved a pair i didnt even think twice before sizing up these are not the same as they used to be made see my pics of old vs new in fact when i opened them up i thought i got cheap hin knockoffs they are so thin the sole feels like a dollar store shoe quality and the nubs are duller also these seem much wider than the originals adidas has done their customers wrong by changing the quality my son wont let me return them because he loves his other pair so much he wants them again but i have a feeling the quality will not outlive his shoe size this time and well definitely be buying a different brand next time
these seemed fake as soon as they came out of the torn up box purchased a wide which is my normal size in nb and there were super tight and small the sole is not attached to the shoe and comes off without any effort and the seams are odd im not sure if they are fake or just very poorly made unlike the other nb shoes i always wear

la horma sobresale mucho en el puente y leha hecho rozaduras no las volvera a comprar
restituite a causa della puzza emessa dalla suola il tipico odore chimico che si sente nei negozi di prodotti fabbricati in cina per fortuna la richiesta di reso stata accettata le scarpe erano belle ed anche comode ma lodore era intollerabile e sospetto che non faccia affatto bene esporsi a queste sotanze

scarso usate per andare da casa a scuola e non sono arrivate a fine stagione
the shoe is poorly made and the outsole seperated after one sprinting event
dieser schuh ist eine klasse fr sich sehr wertig perfekte verarbeitung dementsprechender preis den htte ich sogar gezahlt aber obwohl schon nummern grer bestellt als normal immer noch viel zu klein was soll das wozu sind grenangaben da dass man die schuhe x bestellt mache ich nicht mit die mangelnde nachhaltigkeit durch berflssige versandprozesse ist ein ausschlusskriterium
i was very surprised to feel that this shoe in wide felt narrower than my other columbia boots in regular i cant comment on any other aspect of the footwear as i could not wear them and they were returned immediately

roza en el taln
en la publicacin muestran unos zapatos y me llegaron otros totalmente diferentes
description the same picture isnt
do not purchase this the picture advertised is not the same as the product you will receive incorrect sizing seems to be another issue also stay away
not csa approvedreturned for refund
el zapato izquierdo me quedo bien pero el derecho estaba mucho ms amplio que se me sala al intentar caminar a pesar que eran de la misma talla
i command large wath i got it more like not large but i give star for the quality of the shoe
extremely narrow therefore could only put them on if taking out insoles however length size was accurate so after ordering a size bigger still felt tight while too big i actually have narrow feet but even for me were tight also quality is nowhere near the famous puma king got the reg puma king di fg as the sg were having the studs unscrew easily unless played on natural grass
used for light pick up games on a turf field started falling apart on the second session starting with the tongue tearing and then both souls splitting away from the shoe they also run a bit small
ich habe die schuhe fr den waldkindergarten im sommer ausgesucht mir war wichtig dass sie wasserdicht sind und gut am fu sitzen das ist beides gegeben wie von kamik gewohnt fallen die schuhe kleiner aus sie sind relativ eng am einstieg und passen meinem sohn mit seinen schmalen fen gut er kann sie alleine anziehen und auch enger stellengekauft habe ich sie anfang april durch corona kiga geschlossen hat er sie allerdings nicht oft getragen jetzt anfang juni haben die schuhe an den seiten lcher im obermaterial und sind leider auch nicht mehr dicht bei einer preisempfehlung des herstellers von ein unding ich habe die schuhe reklamiert und muss mich auf die suche nach neuen schuhen machen schade
these are pathetic i purchased these for my dad for fathers day and he said they came apart on the whole side of one runner he has always worn reeboks so what is up with these from here i dont know im not happy about this at all
memnun deilim
my toes were being squished and my heel was lifting out of the shoe with every step too much friction from the rubbing just wont work for me returning
die applikationen aber auch das band fllt sehr schnell aus der verankerung daher nicht so wie gewnscht sicher kann man auch ohne beides auskommen ist halt dann nicht mehr so schn
taill trop grand
el articulo que ped nunca lleg y mi dinero ni idea donde esta le escribo al venderdor y no responde
to small please order one size bigger good quality shoe see pictures comparation they are both size us 
shoes were far too narrow
im a professional dancer and we recently began rehearsals again i brought my new character shoes to use at rehearsal but when i put them on it was extremely disappointing i had gotten a size regular width before and they were far too big i ordered a size narrow width thinking it would solve my problems nope they were hilariously small for reference i own a pair of sperry boat shoes in child size i couldnt even get my foot into them and neither could a fellow dancer with even smaller feet than mine unfortunately with all of the covid stuff i didnt get to try them on until well after the return window had ended so the money i spent is lost
i open a broken box to used shoes these shoes are clearly used really they are sent back
demasiado angostos lo peor que el fabricante no lo especifica y la foto es engaosa es la primera vez que me pasa que un zapato que pido de amazon eeuu no me queda y eso que siempre los pido un nmero ms grande porque tengo empeine alto decepcionada ya no los regres por lo engorroso del trmite
ive been running in wave creations for easily years or more and this new version is not what im used to the tongue is attached to the shoe making it hard to put on the fit is different tighter than previous versions but the most disappointing part is the workmanship with less than km on these shoes they have started disintegrating all through the heel area see photos they started squeaking while i was on a run and upon inspection after running i found that foam padding was breaking down and coming apart these are being returned and ill either wait for the next version or perhaps check out another company sorry mizuno these just arent up to standard 
i had a pair of mizunos for years great shoe when it was time for a new pair i bought the newer model ive been wearing them for less than months and only in my home gym i went to lace them up as usual pulled the laces tighter and the lace ripped right through the hole these are expensive shoes and i would expect better quality amazon wont offer me a credit a refund or a replacement not impressed
folks i would not recommend buying this shoes ive just picked up the shoes and compared with the original and this product is completely terrible the glue is really visible the fabrics cuts are not aligned the front leather fabric has inferior quality compared to the original also the glue was kind of accidentally manufactured poured onto the fabric i will be return this product today
less than km into these shoes part of the sole on the heel just fell off for over shoes that is outrageous that hasnt happened to shoes that had km on them i have been loyal to mizuno for a decade so this is extremely disappointing
es un regalo
en principio contenta bonitos mi hija dice que cmodos pero al mes de uso cogieron un olor horrible es la primera vez que me pasa con esta marca
artikelbeschreibung ist hier leider falsch der hellblau beworbene chuck ist in wahrheit trkis vorsicht also bei der bestellung rcksendung wurde beantragtadd ich warte seit tagen auf die bearbeitung der rcksendung und gutschrift planet sports so soll amazon nicht sein
these are not real johnston and murphys i kept wondering why they fit larger i chalked it up to user error and bought some inserts so i can actually wear them as i put the insoles im i noticed that they were the exact size as my other johnston and murphys so i started digging made in a different country as the other leather was noticeably different then the other every code was different on the tongue of the shoe sole was noticeable different
i love the style of the shoe but it very stiff in the sole this makes it uncomfortable to wear even after trying to break it in
cute but the cut of these did not work for me returned the insole was cushiony but the shape of the boot made it uncomfortable to walk in also the top of the boot has a large opening which is good for accommodating different sizes but it slides around unless you cinch it all the way with the laces which i think will crease the material over time and also just felt kind of weird i would like to see this concept redesigned since it is a cute style but just fits really strangely sizing up or down wouldnt have helped and did not feel very practical
i was so disappointed that these walking shoes would not allow me to slide my foot inside im yrs old and walk my lb dog twice a day these shoes looked like the perfect footwear for light snowfall days hah the opening at the top is too narrow and rigid there are no gussets that allow the opening to widen and accomodate your heel and ankle very poor design because of that i cannot comment on the fit or comfort i had high hopes for these the tread on the bottom of the shoe and the ankle support would have made this a very stable shoeboot
could not get my foot all the way in the shoe no side zipper or opening at the shoe laces to open up the shoe
i was unable to put my foot in the shoe returned immediately
i chose these shoes because of how amazingly they fit my feet when i tried them in an offline store unfortunately they had no proper size so i ended up ordering shoes onlinethe order came in time and in a good shape but on my second visit to bouldering gym i noticed that one of the laces started to tear i didnt pay enough attention to that and that was my big mistake you can see on the pictures how the lace look like after just bouldering sessions its almost totally ruined on the left shoe and started to tear on the right onethis is especially surprising as i do not tie shoes tightly theyre sizes smallerobviously its too late to return them now after months and visible signs of usage is it even possible to have no such signs on climbing shoeslater i found out that this issue is so common for la sportiva solutions that some shoe repairs even have a separate price for replacing laces on this particular model unfortunately there are no specialized shoe repairs nearby and sending shoes to anywhere else is too expensive so now i end up with brand new shoes without lacessummarizing do not buy this model if youre not ready to replace laces right after the purchase
too heavy heal support dug into back of foot
il buco dellinfradito pi largo del dovuto e indossando le ciabatte il piede va allinfuori inoltre fanno rumore quando cammini scarsa qualit della gomma
fanno male gli attacchi delle cinghie sotto i piedi
ich habe eine falsche gre erhalten vermute ich
dieser schuh sieht toll aus aber leider viel zu klein meine tochter hat schuhgre und die schuhe in waren ihr zu klein fllt eher aus wie eine 
purchased my usual size ee and could barely get my foot in the shoe because it was so narrow another time wasting purchase
im a neutral runner and these shoes supposed to be for neutral pronation they are more like stability shoes the side guide rails greatly impeding the rolling transition to toeoff and control the natural motion of the foot i have other adidas shoes with boost midsole which i really like but the boost midsole of these shoes feels completely different dead and nonresponsive the upper is a thick and supportive but leaking dye after the first run my white socks get dyed red the tongue is kind of firm and uncomfortable the comfort is average if you are a neutral runner avoid these shoes by any meanshorrible running shoes
the was looked nice online but once you buy it and see its quiet different experience the size is very small and doesnt fit must buy bigger size
not the color i ordered i ordered all white with black outlined strips so please becareful if you attemp to oder the all white cause your not going to get what you think your going to get pretty disappointed cause i was looking forward to them but they fit nice and are light weight on your feet gave it one star cause i had too give at least one
i ordered a and they fit like an my feet slide in them please try a smaller size i have a feeling that these are classified as runners shoes so they run largeweirdly they lack foot support like the boost that i loved dearly i had little support when walking they are soft but lack supportthe shoe quality feels very flimsy and poor they feel crafted from rubber pool noodles and i can easily see the stripes becoming detached in a week very dissatisfied with the qualitythe design is cool execution is terrible
i love this brand and was shocked these did not fit i got my usual size and they felt tight across the top of my foot and my heel was slipping as i walked they feel a half size larger also the color was odd i purchase white with pink stripes but the white looks more like a blue white it seriously looks like the sneakers were put in the wash with a load of blue jeans and the color bled onto the sneakers the pink stripes look a little cheesey as if they can be peeled right off they are not comfortable at all the sole feels very thin and flat low quality
bought these shoes for my yr old for vacation as she had outgrown all her other shoes she wore them all of hours spanning days time the outer part of the shoe began separating from the sole of the shoe by the nd day i will now have to find her a new pair of shoes for when school starts these shoes did fit as expected and my child loved them too bad they wont last long
after week of usethese are falling apart do not purchase these these shoes must only be meant to wear inside
i am so disappointed with the quality of these shoes they started pulling apart at the soles the first week she wore them and its only continued to get worse shes only worn these for three weeks and im already looking for new shoes for her i have multiple pairs of saucony shoes myself and have always been pleased i am not sure if we just got a bad pair here or what happened
this shoe literally has felt on the bottom it is extremely slippery the shoes are also quite small
my kids wear saucony shoes this is the first poorly made pair weve had she wore them one time they are already splitting at the seam gave her blisters
not found the shoes comfortable as expected and promised
not good
the size shoes not same another shoes skechers i have on us fit in but yours too large
pues no puedo correr con ellas porque me hacen mucho dao en los pes porque es muy fina de delante y me duelen mucho los dedosllegando hacerme sangre en una de ellaspor lo que me las he puesto dos veces y ya las tengo guardadas
la parte posteriore e troppo alto e provoca fastidio al tendine dachille in modo importantemai successo su nessuna scarpa la sportivaho dovuto renderle mio malgradoper me inutilizzabilisono rimasto molto delusopur apprezzando il marchio e tutti gli altri modelli che reputo eccezionali
son tallas muy pequeassi tienes el pie yn poco ancho una talla mas no siempre es suficientemuy mala experiencia con ellosaunque al principo los puse y me van justos tampoco son comodos al cabo de unos kilometros se hace insoportables y hacen mucho daopues aqui los tengo con km y para tirar
im sure these are fake i have owned other alphabounces before and what i liked about them was the light pillowy sole the sole of these shoes are dense and heavy like its made of recycled plastic or something the fit is terrible very wide and loose on my feet and i have wide feet all together they just dont look or feel legit i will be returning them right away
these are not actually adidas i have other pairs of adidas and just liked the color of these they came in an adidas box but the shoe was a fraud and was way larger than it should have been
unfortunately my first pair of brooks i have giving a bad rating the cushion and bottom sole is wearing out already im not over weight they should have a least held up another month
el producto es bueno y de calidadpero en cuestin de las tallas son confusas seleccione una talla de cm y la talla que me trajeron fue la us que es la equivalente a la talla de cm por suerte lo pude usar como regalopero si deben mejorar esto ya que no especifica si la seleccin de la talla que traen es en cm o pulgadas
it is ok but not very great shoe
sind zwar bequem aber sind auch schnell kaputt und quitschen und knacken schon nach kurzer zeit sohle ging schnell kaputt
i am thinking about sending them back i put them on and headed to the store i wear a i ordered a like they recommend i had to take them off while i was driving there are white lace type materials that squeeze your foot and causes the issuei also had trouble putting them on even at a size bigger i had to put them on on the back of my truck to get enough leverage to get them oni took the shoe from a star to a star in my photos youll notice the white lace eyelet remove the shoe string all the way then cut the white lace its actually sewen to the inside of the shoe which is why it gets so friggin tight then feed your shoe string through one of the holes where the white lace was and lace them like normal shoes they over thought this for too long i have the jjs and theyre tight too jjs arent as tight with what modification i mentioned above
better looking picture than actual product fits smaller and tighter and the little stripe that runs across it kills the shoe i thought o could look past that but couldnt returned them
ran smallnarrow my husband loves the jj watt s but these fit different still nice and have to a family member just size up
i brought these shoes for my son but after seeing them i did not like them at all
difficult to slide foot in back id show suppler is pushed in and runs up against heel all day you can actually see the divot on back of shoe horrible purchase i will forever be off balance in the future asics want a new customer 
its a slip on shoe and hard to put on the material stays dirty after you wash it and overall a bad shoe rubs on your ankles and gives blisters
my daughter absolutely loves converse shoes and she loves the color of these slip on shoes except her feet slip out of the shoes they are the right size but they are also a bit heavy so her heels come up at every step she can only wear them with really thick socks we are going to have to put shoe laces in the shoes which defeats the purpose of the slip on if you want the shoes because of the slip on feature then i do not recommend
this product was not a good fit since we are stationed abroad returning or exchanging for a more appropriate size is quite difficult
i bought these for the start of school and months later they have holes in front very disappointed by this model my son is but a shoes should last more than months
las zapatillas son buenas pero pido una talla y esper ms de una semana para estar disponibles para ser enviadas recib talla estoy completamente decepcionado
das produkt wurde woche von einem gehenden monate alten kind getragen und vorne haben beide schuhe ein loch der zwilling trgt schuhe derselben firma anderes modell und diese haben normale abnutzungen ich bestelle seit jahren superfit und bin zum ersten mal wirklich unzufrieden ich habe bereits reklamiert und bin gespanntob dies funktioniert
nachdem unser sohn die schuhe monate getragen hat ist ein ca cm groes loch im leder wir sind von superfit sonst bessere qualitt gewohnt fr den preis haben wir mehr erwartet
ive had sketchers wide before and they were amazing but these are very narrow not wide at all also the shoe does not breathe socks will be soaking wet and gross
no no no is not a breathable mesheverything it was according to description but is real plastic mesh and your foot it looks like is inside ovenchoose something else
unfortunately they dont last weeks and the metal bindings on straps fail making the sandal unwearable its too bad as clarks name used to mean quality
i bought these in oct for summer after only weeks of wear this spring stay at home orders in canada the metal linkbuckle has worn right through the leather heel strap making them unfixable this is our rd pair of clarks sandals and we have never had a problem beforevery disappointed
en medio del envi se regreso el producto no llego nunca
comfortable but cheaply constructed the clip which holds the rear of the right sandal to the side broke today after only a month of intermittent use my last clarks lasted a decade evidently quality has slipped pay more and avoid this now unacceptable brandedit oct amazons outstanding customer service exchanged the broken pair for another which broke today only a few months of light use later with the same issue im out on a lousy purchase dropping rating to one star and will not under any circumstances purchase clarks again
ive been wearing these kind of clarks sandals for over years i think clarks has slipped a bit on the quality control of this model though the first pair that came fit fine they felt good but before even days expired the metal loop that holds the back strap to the side broke clean off no problem everyone can have a bad day rightas expected the return process was clean and easy i reordered the same model thinking i had a bad apple and they came very quicklyi decided id loosen the back strap up a little just in case i was putting too much pressure on the metal loop nope within three weeks the same thing happened this is clearly a poor designi still like clarks but they have a clunker here i do not recommend this product
cmo te estos zapatos pero llegaron muy grandes y solicit la devolucin desde el de octubre y es fecha que no han pasado a recoger el paquete
surprisingly after weeks of jogging i noticed its heels were getting worn out i am deeply disappointed with this purchase
i received the first time with manufacturing defects also the size i usually take was a little too big for me when i received the second replacement pair another manufacturing issue was present the white sole covering was peeling off after just one day product to be seriously avoided
i was looking forward to these shoes for a summer trip but they ended up being entirely too big and they were warped probably from being squished for a long period during shipment i think that maybe if they had fit better i would have worn them and the warp would have gone away but no i just threw them in a corner and eventually threw them out 
niente da dire sullefficienza di amazon nella puntualit della consegna le scarpe tuttavia mi hanno lasciato delusa sono state consegnate in una bustina senza scatola lodore di plastica molto forte anche a molte ore dallapertura del pacco calzandole le ho trovate un po larghe e conferiscono al piede un aspetto non piacevole direi che per euro si pu avere di meglio
sneakers do not come in a box and im actually questioning the authenticity of the product
el zapato tiene un diseo diferente al de la foto le falta una letra n y la franja de la suela es ms delgada a la de la foto la suela tambin es diferente
size but they are smaller than the size my son is outgrowing very disappointed
i was surprised how great this blouse looks on the color and texture are awesome very well made but runs a tad small this will be my new go to when i open my closet
love this top super soft and drapes great even after washing it is pretty long and loose but it is so comfy and cute to wear with jeans or even joggers
love these tanks so much i have them in every color i wear them layered under blouses thermals henleys blazers etc im typically and extra small but the small fits perfectly
these jeans are so comfortable they are wellmade they are the perfect pair of jeans the only thing i do not love is they stretch out a little bit after wearing i am going to order these again in the next smaller size
comfortable and soft are two of my favorite words when it comes to clothes this shirt meets both requirement it is a great length and can be casual and dressed up must have for fall and winter
this shirt spoke to me as soon as i entered the store i love the colorful plaid the flattering cut and the light airy material at very least i think this will be a threeseason go to
this is the softest most perfectly cut basic love the black wish the white was a true white or ivory instead of heathered as usual with retailer basics i prefer the regular length despite being petite with a short torso
this product is just what i wanted it was a great color and nice quality for the price it is tighter than the model but i am curvy and thats usually the case looks cute with a patterned pant and jewelry
bought this shirt in red in my usual size small it is so comfortable and easy to wear i am tall and it fall on me similar to the model in the picture not sure if i can wear with leggingsmay be too short in front im looking forward to layering it under sweaters and sweater vests for a pop of color
i am giving it five stars because the colors and design are so beautiful but i am a medium size around and i chose the ml which is just too big i also found a run in the fabric which is very loose and knitlike in places but i dont care i am exchanging for another one in small
i purchased this top on colorsa great go tostylish soft and very comfortable
this tunic is a great way to wear the plaid trend right now without it being the traditional collared shirt its fun comfortable and has great style the first time i wore it i got tons of compliments im and the back of the shirt goes to the back of my knees i usually wear a size and the large fit great
i really looked forward to receiving this piece it was however extremely difficult to get on and off you have to step into it and it is very narrow it is difficult to get your arms in and i had to have my husbands help getting it off i am pounds i have a fit figure i ordered a medium i wear a small or xsmall for a top and an in shorts or pants once it was on i was not thrilled with the extra material around the hips and tummy area it is not terribly becoming it bunches up
im about lbs overweight and the material clings a bit this would be a wonderful top for someone who has a nice shape
when i saw this on a model at my retailer store i fell for it i love the colors and the weave of this kimono it looks great over anything denim or chambray in particular it will be useful for cooler days and nights or airconditionied places the knit cuffs hold it in place i got many compliments on it the first time i wore it
comfortable jacket that your can cross your arms and your back is not stuck it is stretchy
i really love this addition to my wardrobe the colors are great and it is very comfortable my only complaint is that it runs large it would be nice if they had more than two sizes
pretty blues colors are exactly as pictured fits perfectly not boxy not tight just comfortable im and this is tunic length on me
the stitching is why i like this dress even though the arms and waist were a little large on me i decided to keep it because of the beautiful pattern i think going a size down from what i normally wear would be too tight across my back or too short i will wear it with a cardigan tights and boots as the weather gets cooler
i love everything about this tunic the color fabric and design i am very happy with this perches
i absolutely love this top especially for fl weather its soft and falls just a tad longer in the back and is a little fitted in the bust area with a very feline look i had the tank as well and just love the satin trim i will say it runs a little smaller than the tank bc i have xs in the tank and needed a small in this love it
the title says it all perfect goto tank for underneath tops smooths out lines purchased in a large so if youre between sizes may want to size up
i was first attracted to this tunic by the beautiful bright colors tried it on and it was becoming comfortable and perfect for my laidback lifestyle i just bought it a week ago have worn it three times already i bought the blue
it actually is a pretty good tshirt but i wish that i had known that white actually means oatmeal with bits of grey and beige i bought three and will now need to return them all hopefully i can find it in other colors i like
nice practical tank that i can wear with everything but the fabric is kind of weird overly warm and pulls up around the bottom when i wear it sometimes i would still recommend it but just know its not just a cotton tank
i was in love with this top as soon as i saw it i love the patchwork and i think it is well put together ive worn it once the day i got it i was so excited and washed it and it is still in great shape i liked it with the sleeves rolled up and the bottom tucked in as it was a little longer than im used to but nothing too long my torso is short the material is not thick or heavy and the sleeves and some patches are kinda thin nice material but not something to wear if its very ch
i have these in many different colors some with stripes very versatile and i wear them all year aroundholds well through the washing love these tank top
great material and i like the idea of a scoop v neck combination but the hem rolls up making it impossible to wear not tucked in to pants or a skirt and even there its a little bulky its possible that ordering a size up would fix the problem
love this top im pounds athletic build and the medium falls slightly loosely and very nicely over my hips it is quite low cut so i wear a tank under it in a professional environment but its fine to wear sans tank top in a more casual setting i really love the back as the straps are sexy and show off my shoulders the material seems to be good quality and i would order this in more colors if it were available
i saw this dress in the catalog and online and it looked so lovely on the models i took a chance and ordered it in my normal size small when it arrived i was a little disappointed with the weight of the fabric it was a bit light in my opinion it did have an interesting texture suede like so i could overlook the weight of the fabric if the dress fit well unfortunately it did not it rather just hung there and was not flattering on me it looked wonderful on the model but i keep forgettin
i had read all the reviews about the regular length being too long they were out of stock on the petite when i ordered but i took a chance and ordered the regular size i love it it is a little long in the back but i think that makes it a little more fun than your standard plaid shirt so cute with skinny jeans and leggings it is one of my favorite fall tops i got the blue but might go back and get the red since it would be so great for the holidays
its perfect perfect fit long enough to wear leggings and cover my behind its perfect
look carefully at the pics of the back if this style and the color suit you just go ahead and order this one it looks just like the pics and is light comfortable and true to size the kind of top you can throw on when you are in a hurry and look great however because the back is sheer from halfway down maybe not for work if you work in an office moth is one of my favorite brands at retailer and this one is easypeasy i am c and ordered the regular s
i just received this top in the mail and i couldnt be happier with how it fits and feels on might have to wear a camisole under with a bit see through in front it is very true to size and drapes beautifully with the back being very feminine i am and the length falls just about the same on myself as does the model i will wear with skinny jeans with the nice length working well with them
i love this top i am d ordered a small and it fit perfectly length is long but i liked it i paired it with grey jeans and black wedge bootslove this top
this shirt is comfortable loose but doesnt make you look like youre shapeless it compliments
top was featured in an email ad i love the colors in both tops and bought both plaids im about lbs and the medium fits well it is long in the back but i like that if the front were a little longer id prefer that but the length is ok the colors are definitely cheery and moodenhancing very appropriate for this holiday season
theres something wonderful about this tee its the way it fits it hangs so nicely and is a wonderful year round item i bought it in black for myself and one for my daughter she ordered another color and i did too when i bought it one of the gals at the store said it had been such a popular tee this year and once i put it on i understood why i give it a high rating
if youre not a petite and are reading this read on im always on the lookout in the petite section because many times us fuller girls can fit into these pros tts for me im normally a size ml in the regular sizes i tried on the p and it fit everywhere perfectly especially at the bust in which im a c fabric is on the thicker side but thats what gives it this adorable shape besides already being fitandflare pockets i always lean towards dresse
this pair of age stevie capris is everything that i could want in a pair of jeans soft sexy without being skintight and the perfect color of blue i am lbs and the was a perfect fit these hit about an inch above my ankle and looked amazing think legs that look a mile long with booties one night and nude heels the next
i usually wear a s the reviews were helpful looking at the pic this shirt does look a little on the fitted side i ordered a size m it fits perfectly the sleeve length is fine too the colors are dark not as in the photo i do like the frayed edge look too i have some skinnys like that i had been looking at this shirt for months but thought it was a bit pricey at the sale price plus the promo discount it makes it very much worth it no regrets hope this isnt tmi of note the dark bl
wow love this blazer its not as structured as some blazers but the woven fabric hugs in the right places fantastic addition and great alternative to the goodol black blazer great versatility work to play nice weight for fall but will also do well for my fl winter its longer than some of my other blazers but i like it with the front pockets as they are it makes for a unique design that gets noticed i got the size and i have broad shoulders for someone lbs makes for a n
i love this shirt great fabric nice quality flattering fit i have gotten this shirt in colors my only complaint is that the color names do not match the actual color not sure who named these the orange is a lovely burgundy and the white is actually oatmeal
one of the best tops i have ever bought i love he material and the style the satin trim around the edges adds a classy touch i wore this top with yoga pants and then with jeans and it was perfect for both outfits the shirt is true to size i wear a size small and it fit perfectly lbs b
this dress can be dressed up or down it looks cute w a black open sweater and looks great alone the fabric is very soft although it isnt fitted it doesnt have too much material either so it is very flattering on the back yoke also has the white embroidered flowers which finishes off a quality look the pockets are nice and light inside i usually wear a and the large fit perfectly i was also lucky to get it on sale 
i am most pleased with this tunic purchased it in red nice quality and very comfortable casual top it has a flattering cut that isnt boxy for a long tunic so its flattering the weight of the fabric is substantial but not heavy or stiff so it doesnt add any bulk which is a bit slimming it would work well for a wide variety of body types i may buy the blue as well
love these jeans flattering and comfortable great length for short girl worth the money
i received this tee in grey as gift and immediately went online to buy another beware because the color names are confusing i originally thought it was a mix up in the naming on the website so i ordered the red thinking id get the red colored tee however the red tee is actually a light orange color the orange tee is actually a burgundyred color i ended up keeping the orange colored tee although i actually wanted the red color because i really do love the quality of this shirt
as the previous reviewer mentioned this dress is great for a dress that doesnt have a true waist it really fits awesome so incredibly soft high quality material and the mesh pockets are perfection pockets that are so smalllight that you cant tell the dress even had them when looking at it the color of the dress is what initially drew me to it definitely a different color for a sun dress and after trying it on in stores i would say beware though it truly is a rich and different c
i got this jacket in the gray the fit is amazing and it is soooooo comfortable i love that it is a bit less structured but still looks polished
beautiful neutral color in a comfortable fabric fits tts i am ft in and went with the petite it is a midi on me i have other skirts from retailer from past years in similar fabric and will say that overtime the waist will stretch even if hand washed carefully so that being said buy your size in this skirt dont go bigger to get a longer length you can wear it lower on your hips if you like it longer which i think actually looks more flattering in any case its a great piece that no o
i love the print and quality and safari look to me it does run tight across the shoulders i would size up
it is delightful dreamy and yes it is quite right perfect fit i wear a size and it was right on
great skirt easy to wear perfect weight for springfall very comfortable while still looking stylish the xs fit well
these are very versatile pants you can pair them with a tank top and flip flops and be ready for a casual summer day or pair them with a dressy top and heels and be ready for a formal function ive only worn these once to a formal city function and felt put together and comfortable with the pants i wore a black lace button up top satin peep toe heels black tuxedo jacket and a chunky necklacevery cute my husband loved it im lbs and the xs fit perfectly they only downside to
i am a horse lover so i had to have it as it is of good quality and unique be mindful that it runs small and fits alittle snug across shoulder also excellent for layering
definitely cute and good fit but the distressing at knee is open and will probably get worse worth it if price lower maybe
this general sweatshirt is cute stylish and can be dressed up or down a fresh alternative to the standard grey sweatshirt with leggings for casual mornings
i love the models pairing of this sweatshirt and was struck by it when i walked in the store like the other reviewer said you could dress up or down despite the sweatshirt name and im planning to wear it with the galleria corduroy skirt and gray booties love the stitched pockets on the side but im unlikely to put anything there since it would probably fall out sizing definitely boxy as the first reviewer said im solidly a small in most tops and this one i have a bit of spare
i was looking for a top that would be comfortable as fall was approaching and this hit the mark it isnt fitted but it doesnt look sloppy either though it is comfy and is called a sweatshirt the fabric allowed me to pair it with a charcoal skirt i am very pleased with this shirt and would highly recommend it as it can be worn casually with jeans or paired with a skirt
i tried this skirt on in a size medium i am usually a small inches around the hips and butt but there were no size smalls the medium looked good but the waistline may have been a tad loose the texture of the skirt is wonderful and it is lined overall the quality seemed good and it had a nice heft to it the only thing i might say is that is is quite longcloser to my ankles and im just shy of and leggy to boot i wear a inseam with flats with tall boots on you saw j
saw these in store and had to have them online pictures do not do them justice great pattern fabric and features can be dressed up or down sizing is accuratei am and lbs and bought an xs they fit perfectly wish they had more colorspatterns to purchase
i received these pants today and theyre perfect as another reviewer stated i would definitely not wear these for lounging you can dress them up or down i feel like these will be my favorite goto pants this spring i highly recommend the design and pockets are perfect
this shirt has much less color variation in person online it appears vaired imo in person it is a darker classic charcoal grey with little to no color variation this shirt is very soft of medium weight and fits tts the buttons down the back of the shirt are functional and the backside pleating ensures you dont show too much skin if you opt to leave one or two unbuttoned this is just a nice allround staple shirt there is no highsuper low shirt tail hem additio
i hesitated to buy this skirt even though it was love at first sight i was afraid it would be to heavy and add weight im so happy i ordered this one itll be a closet staple for me i love skirts and am blessed to live in a mild climate in california i can wear it all year long right now i can pair it with a slim turtleneck tucked in with high heel boots or heels later can pair with crisp white button up tide at the waist and strappy sandals or a tank top and sandals it goes with
i agree with the previous reviewer the color variation is much more subtle than what is shown online i would not have bought it had i not seen it in real life this is a super cute soft and comfortable shirt it fits tts and can be worn with jeans leggings or a skirt for reference im and lbs and i took a small but probably could have gone with xs as well but i like the extra room
love this sweatshirt will look great with gray pilcro jeans i bought recently xs fits perfectly and i am usually a s or xs
not your classic sweatshirt can be worn with black grey mauve
i am not generally a fan of sweatshirts but when i saw this on a recent retailer email i new i had to check it out the colors are more vibrant in person and not muted like the photo but this wasnt a deal breaker for me because of the boxy shape i went with a s i love the cozy feel and that it is still stylish i can see this piece getting a lot of use this fallwinter in fact i am wearing it right now
i havent worn these yet but i wouldnt wear them just to lounge in i wear an xs they fit good tts they have an elastic waist but it drapes nice doesnt bunch like some do the material is soft hangs nice doesnt seems like it will wrinkle love the pattern of the black print ones its black tan white kind of a paisley print i think it looks better on than in the picture
i tried this on in the store and loved it it is very comfortable i sized up one or two sizes i am very thin and somewhat petite but wanted a little more length it will be a great dress for fall as the fabric is heavy enough to wear into fall i think it looks better in person than online would recommend it if you like this kind of dress love that it has pockets too great quality
i was debating getting the petite vs regular sizing i ended up going with the regular sizing for the addition couple of inches in length it is very comfortable and not at all a sweatshirt but more of a heavyweight wider long sleeve
i was looking for a dress that had a lot of color since i usually stick to neutrals this was out of my comfort zone but i found this one and loved it its comfortable not clingy and i can wear a regular bra bonus i wish the waist wasnt dropped but i think it worked well i plan on wearing it more in the springsummer dressing it up or down will be easy im usually a size and this fit true to size
i bought this top to add some more color and pattern to my summer wardrobe it is really cute and a flattering cut i just had a baby so its perfect for showing some curves without clinging if anything id say it maximizes my bustline more than i expected but is still very flattering i think im still getting used to my new bustline soft comfy fabric not too hot i get compliments when i wear it
very old color and item a little full but comfortable
wore this dress recently on a work trip traveled very well cut and fabric are super flattering
i was hesitant about buying this at first because im busty fcup but i love this top and have received a lot of compliments on it and then i tried it on again at home with leggings and loved it its a great spring time top to wear with leggings and boots
this is the most perfect dress ive ever bought im and the length was perfect the cut is flattering and very slimming the fabric is gorgeous and the pattern is stunning please offer more dresses in this cut
love this top bought it in black and first day i wore it to a party and i think everyone gave me a compliment it is very flattering to my shape have a bit of a pooch and cant even tell looks great with skinny jeans look forward to wearing many more times
very happy with my purchase fit very nice already received compliments
also a little on the bigger size i ended up not keeping the xs petite as i felt it was a little loose and long would have been more flattering on me a tad narrower and a bit more above my knee colors are really pretty and so is the pattern very comfortable and light xs petite bog on lbs dd in wasit
i really love the look and feel of this top perhaps this was mentioned in previous reviews but it is unlined which i hadnt realized when i ordered it so the eyelet details are will expose skin unless you wear a cami underneath
i bought this top in the store and love it i was surprised to see negative reviews online i am small chested curvier on the bottom this top does have a wide and short fit but the cut is flattering all three colors are beautiful i wear it with high waist short jean shorts and it looks very fresh
i ordered the xl and it fits me the same as pictured on the model so its true to size the peplum is very comfortable i love the mix of colors especially for fall ive always had great luck with the fit wear of this brand id love to see this same style done in lighter colors for summer
fits well comfortable and flattering i wouldnt call this pattern fabric purple though it is definitely multi colored and purple should not be called the dominate color the picture is an accurate representation of the color
lovely top that will be a great yearround staple to my wardrobe peplum and pleats are flattering and not bulky good weight for spring and beautiful for fall with a cardigan looking forward to wearing it with high rise jeans and and pencil skirts
this top is so pretty i purchased the peach color it does run large so you will need to size down you do not need to wear a cami which is nice in the summer it will look great with jeans white jeans shorts dress it up or down its not suppose to fit tight love it
i lucked out and found one of these in my local retailer and i absolutely love it fits well although i do think that the sleeves run a tad bit narrow when they are folded up but i prefer the dress with the sleeves down anyway fits very true to size i cant wait to wear this with boots and leggings
ok received this in the mail yesterday and tried on this morning i ordered the size snd it is really big i notice that the armhole sag and there is a lot of extra room everywhere i am a d on the top so that is why i ordered the size but i will return this and order the size and i hope that will take care of the sagging arm area
like the other reviewers have said this is a wider shirt but the width done is in a stylish way i did not think it looked frumpy or sacklike on however i found it to be rather short i bought a regular not petite and it fits shorter than many shirts i have from retailer madewell etc which have the same looser fit i am lbs so it is odd that it fit somewhat short on meif you are tall it might bare your midriff some i bought the peach which was close to the color pictu
i ordered this in a s for reference i am lb dd with a waist and it fits nicely i have a fairly large chest but i didnt find that the pleats laid awkwardly or overaccentuated my boobs but i got the purple motif so the pattern and the higher neckline may have helped keep the top looking cute and stylish but still modest on me the top drapes a little more than than it does on the model but its flattering and not at all sloppy thanks to the fabric which has a jus
i bought this top in colors it was endlessly comfortable and easy to wear so i bought it in the rd color its so versatile that i found myself trying to wear it in too many situations travel weekends and work the feel of the fabric is gorgeous but it pills after wear so when the top went on sale i bought an extra set of all colors now i have a set for play and a set for work i love this shirt
this top is absolute perfection i dont think the photo does it justice as it looks so much better untucked i dont even have great toned arms but its still so flattering i got the gray one amd might get another color great value as well im petite and bought my usual size small
i originally bought this from my local retailer in an xs petite i think it was a return i brought it home and decided it was just too big for my frame i ordered it in an xxs petite and am keeping it the colters are just so pretty and it is machine washable which is an added bonus it is still flowy but not objectionably so it is meant to be unstructured and bohemain i think looking forward to wearing this on my upcoming trip to italy
i really am happy with this purchase i am only and this will be a perfect dress for me the cuts hit at just the right spot
i know a lot of folks thought this top was too bigboxy but im pretty slim up top with a big booty quintessential pear shape and i think the shape is totally flattering your mileage may vary but with free returns id just try it on first i sized down one size which helped and got the raspberry colored one i adore the color its impossibly vibrant and beautiful for spring summer or fall the eyelets dont have any cloth underneath just bare skin but theyre so small that i don
lovely sweater that is good with jeans or a skirt i ordered an xl and my only complaint is that i wish it were a bit longer in the front i am heavy chested though so thats how most tops fit me i ordered the grayblack and its really nice i receive lots of compliments
i absolutely love this blousei ordered it in peachthen waited for the raspberry to come back in my sizenow i have colorsit runs really largebut putting a tank or cami underneath is fun 
a fun top i tried on both the medium and large im between sizes g and preferred the large the medium waist rode up a bit on my torso so the large stayed down a bit also the medium pleats did not fall as nicely on my chest
im surprised there are no reviews on this blouse yet ive had it for a couple of months and love it it looks great in the spring with my flora retailer infinity scarf the color is beautifulive gotten many compliments on this too it fits well and has a small texture which makes it more interesting
must wear tank under or i feel immodest due to eyelet holes beautiful im machine washing w delicates n hang dry comes out great easy breezy
great dramatic cardigan wearable art and not for the meek ill wear with a leather skirt and boots jeans and boots or a dress and boots if the lack of closure at top bothers you attach something be creative i like the movement that alternately hides and reveals the statement jewelry worn
i bought of these in peach and maize the fabric is yummy and soft as silk the eyelet detail gorgeous and the colors are great however there is too much fabric if only a bit less the fabulous swing shape would work that said im keeping mine if just for the gorgeous fabric and colors i would even consider buying the third color just to wear around the house if sale was on sale again
weighs nothing so comfortable great length not too short fits a tad loose but very pretty and easy to wear fun print flattering casual style with a touch of class lbs and the xs fits just as it shows on the model
i am and wear between a pant and ml tops depending i would consider myself a pear bodytype bc i have a thicker midsection and flat everywhere else for this i ordered a medium and it was slightly loose so if you are conscious about your midsection ordering your normal size will probably be fine the fabric is very lightweight like a normal drapey tshirt would be made out of just to keep in mind the draping is really cool though i would just probably handwash dryclean or if
i had this on my wish list as soon as it came in i just bought it last week and im so glad i did i bought the purple print and it is really pretty here in northern cal i can wear this almost year round i am often right between sizes when it comes to deletta tops this one is a little bit big im hoping that the extra room will help keep it cool during our degree days
i bought the purple motif in size medium my regular retailer size the fit is true to size the knit is soft and comfortable this top can be dressed up or worn casually it is a great allaround basic top for summer
this shirt dress has the right amount of body skimming drape and length to flatter my short potbellied square waisted self i wish they made more versions more colors more sleeves
i can wear this top with jeans or a business suit the cowl neck is the best part it gives this garment a little pop yesterday i combined it with a black business suit and white pearls i had so many compliments
i ordered my usual size s in the purple print this peplum top style colorspattern will go easily with pretty much anything shorts pants jeans skirts wear for casual or dress it up for me the fit is tts armholes provide good coverage length is fine the top has a bit of stretch doesnt feel restrictive the waist is banded a little loose which is fine dont like tight fitting waists on tops i like that the waist seems a little lower than other peplum tops at retailer the skirt
love this tank the purple motif is gorgeous and the carbon color is a rich dark gray with a slight blue tinge at with a fairly proportionate torso to leg ratio i sometimes need a petite in tops like this to avoid the armholes being too long in this top i found the petite small too short but the regular small was perfect the waist hits right above my natural waist the hem is just a skosh lower than the model photo and the armholes are the right length beautiful flattering cu
i get that its a swing tank and its supposed to be loose but i got a p and its huge too much material with that being said its such a cute top that i decided to keep it i got it taken in about inches on each side and it now looks great
this dress is absolutely lovely i couldnt leave the store without it even though it was full price and i have a million dresses its just that great i am lbs and bought the small
this shirt has it all great staple piece to add to your wardrobe not only is it classy with a pair of black pants and booties but you can add a little spice to it by dressing it up with some funky earrings found it to be a bit large in the armpit area so i sized down
i love this feminine blouse and the gorgeous colors on its a fresh shape that is truly flattering i like that it comes in specific sizes so the proportions seem accurate i bought the in peach all the colors are very pretty i am a usual medium and am f so the regular brafriendliness is essential this is a new fuller shape for me im on a quest at this time of year for clothing that feels comfortable in the beginning heat of summer and this is a lovely choice you could pair it w
this shirt is a steal at the sale price ive received many compliments it is a swing top so not a lot of form i wear a cami underneath have found the style to be comfortable for work
like the other reviewer said the print is more beautiful in person i am usually a small in meadow rue and this fits well in a small my only issue is that the lining hangs out from the bottom and hangs out unevenly hopefully i can exchange it or get it sewed up evenly
this a beatifully made top it does run large so i sized down it has a very floaty quality but it truly lovely so i kept it and glad i did ive had many compliments have run a ribbon through the holes around the waist once to pull it in and it worked really well its convertible
this top is super flattering and comfortable perfect summer wear
this cute top is made in the usa yay it is a flattering cut and looks great under jackets i prefer the ivory color and feel of the fabric the black and white was cute but hung strangely and felt stiff i am size smmed c and went with the small cowl is cozy and can be styled to keep you warm
perfect very pretty and flattering without being too fussy helps to hide my tummy and very well made that said i have fairly wide shoulders and a larger ribcage so i had to size up considerably usually a or a and i needed a to be comfortable the went on but the fabric has no give so i sized up i am never a but thats what worked in this blouse surprisingly it still looked nice and tailored definately runs on the smaller side lovely worth the full price in my opinion
this skirt is so light and breezy perfect for hot or humid weather the first time i wore it i got compliments all day long the length is perfect for a more conservative look i dont wear mini skirts and the slit on the side shows just the right amount of leg it runs a bit large so i had to go down a size
i love this blouse its really pretty and very flattering it makes your waist look small i usually wear a size or after reading the reviews saying it ran small i ordered an and a the fit perfectly so i didnt even try the on it is a little difficult to get on and off due to the zipper on the side that is my only complaint
beautiful airy well made blouse very flattering and feminine i normally wear a size and ordered a per the other reviews and i am glad i did the fit id perfect
very flattering and love style print and color i sized up one size and perfect fit great with page grey wash skinny mid rise jeans
im not typically a fan of pilcro pants compared to paige or other brands like j brand however these simple black skinny jeans were just what i was looking for they hit perfectly at the ankle and look great with a bootie they are quite stretchy and i like my black jeans truly like a legging so i sized down sizes im typically between a and and i purchased a in these initially they were snug around the waist but eased with wear the material is flexible yet sturdy
this top is lovely great colors for spring light material flowy and the cinching below the bust line creates a super flattering silhouette i did have to size up to a im almost always a to make some room for the girls im a cd depending on the brand so larger chested women may want to size up but its well worth it
this blouse is romantic and timeless the tonal print is lovely the peplum cut flattering i followed the advice of other reviewers and ordered one size up which fits perfectly it has a hidden side zip to make for easier off and on i love the mix of cotton and silk which makes it breathable and lightweight thank you retailer for finally making a blouse with natural fabrics that do not need a cami underneath perfect for warm climates
i used to be a solid then had to move down to and i am and lbs in this definitely a the tighter part in the fitted waist is why i recommend peiople sizing up if you are between sizes choose bigger teh cutis so flattering it wont matter the colros are really pretty the flow of the shirt is romantic sleeves are forgivin cant go wrong hte back is a little longer and covers the tushy i can see this with flared bottoms or pencil skirt or skiny jeans even
i love the fit of these pants starts for that i wish the pockets were a little closer together but its not the end of the world considering how well they fit the real drawback is that the dye runs like no other pants ive had before i had them on for a few hours and my fingernails had turned green and my skin was a greenish color i am going to try to soak them in water a few times to see if that helps i would still recommend these pants but wash them a couple times before you wear the
this is a very feminine and pretty top but it runs really small after reading the reviews i ordered a size larger however i think i should have ordered sizes larger
i love this top it has the pattern and detailing that i feel like retailer used to do consistently but often skimps on now tit definitely runs small i usually wear a in retailer tops sometimes a and the is quite fitted on me
this is a gorgeous blouse but it runs small in my opinion i consistently wear a size in moulinette soeurs and im trying to decide if a will still be too small and if i need to exchange for a construction and materials are lovely just consider sizing up if you purchase this blouse
based on the two reviews on this skirt and for the sale price i purchased the smalli m usually a largeextra large i carry my weight in the middle and this skirt stills works very sofisticated striping slimming i havent experienced any slipping but i havent worn it for any great length of time yet there are numerous ways to create chic looks
beautiful top but runs very small based on some of the reviews that i read i ordered two sizes up from my usual size and it is still a little tight in the chest and around the ribs i would like to exchange for the next size up but it is sold out in that size considering how small this blouse runs it would have been nice if retailer had ordered some extra tops in larger sizes as i am sure that many people will have to size up regardless i love the blouse and would definitely recommend it to an
this top is adorable runs a bit small but so cute worth the price and tons of compliments
this blouse is very beautiful and flattering its just a little bit see through so i will wear a cami underneath as with sizing i did size up as the other commenters recommended to do so
i purchased this blouse for an easter brunch and couldnt be happier the feminineromantic print is a gorgeous addition to my spring wardrobe ive paired it with a pencil skirt and heels for a dressier look as well as my favorite ag cuffed denim and sandals for a more casual daytime look
light and airy runs really small had to go up sizes a little pricy but overall a cute blouse not your typical blouse
this top is very pretty and figureflattering because of the way it nips in under the bust the neckline and color are also flattering however it runs a bit small and you need to get the right fit for the bust balancing the band under the bustline with the roominess of the chest area there is a side zipper but it can still be a little tricky to get on and off i wound up not buying it due to the price but id probably snap it on sale
when i saw this top i had to have itruns very small would size up especially if curvy on topsheer but not too sheer feels and looks delicate no problems so far
i just purchased this cute top at my local retailer store and definetely the size is way off in blouses i wear a size small or medium with a b bust tall and slender and i had to purchase a size what overall so cute and could not pass it up good luck try it on before purchasing
beautifuldelicate and unique cotton blouse that accentuates the waist and falls nicely down the belly i love the floral print very appropriate for springsummer i agree with the other reviewers whove mentioned that it runs small i have a bust size of dd and waist size and i had to size up to nevertheless i am really looking forward to wearing this with a pair of skinny jeans and some nude pumps for a girls night out
oh my goodness i paid full price for this dress because i loved it so much i styled it with a cream lace poncho also from retailer and it is gorgeous at the sale price you cant lose
this jacket is really cute i tried in in a large in the store and was too big so i took a chance and ordered medium on line i have broad shoulders so i was a bit worried its perfect very fitted and cropped but will look great to throw on over a dress for reference im foot inches and a c lbs slender but athletic medium was perfect
i have always love tracy reese products this blouse is really fun nice fabric and the proportions are perfect but why does it have to show the wide band of my bra across my back the cut out dips low so i cant imagine a bra that would work with it its a s hippy themed blouse maybe the designer expects us to go braless unfortunately im going to have to wear a cami underneath it my girls need support
what a beautiful harbinger of spring this blouse is so lovely and uplifting for me tts i bought the size b and it fits perfectly this is a fitted blouse especially in the waistline so i understand why some say size up the print is pretty with muted shades of pinks and burgundies the detailing of beige lace and the tiny buttons on the waist adds a very feminine touch along with the added interest on the back of the blouse the fabric is soft but not overly sheer
this is a beautiful blouse that runs one to two sizes too small i usually wear an maybe a on a bad day i couldnt get into the the was uncomfortably tight and even the was snug i havent worn a size anything since i was pregnant years ago i think this blouse would look best on a woman without any curves as it adds curves to any womans body since i already have curves i felt like jessica rabbit in this blouse it was too much for me again lovely blouse but i would no
i love this blouse its very flattering gives the illusion of an hourglass shape the fabric feels soft and flowy and the pattern is pretty it does need a camisole underneath because its kinda sheer it does run small i usually wear a size in retailer clothes but i bought a size in this shirt and the sleeves are still very snug around my forearms which is unusual for me
this dress is probably the most comfortable dress ive ever had the fabric is very comfortable and breathable and it flatters my straight body type
great romper i personally would not wear it for ever day i will be wearing it for a beach cover up while on vacation for reference i ordered a m and am b
very feminine and romantic blouse i love it it runs small as other reviewer said i had to go size up as i want to wear a cami under it the fabric is soft and sheer the design emphasizes the nature curve of a womans body in a good way back is longer than the front part if you like romantic floral prints and soft fabric this one is a winner
i saw this gorgeous blouse in a store over dark blue jeans on feb of course the store stock only went up to a size typical with the way the fit i knew i had to size up from my usual size and i did i ordered it in a size and it arrived on monday feb with lighteningfast speed it is breathtaking and fits wonderfully i like the top button undone the buttons are gorgeous and the blouse is very retro circa but you definitely have to go up one size the only
overall great romper i have a long torso and thicker legs so i sized up to a small and i am very happy i did the shorts are a bit on the shorter side and go upon the sides so another reason to consider sizing up the quality is great and super soft chambray with a trendy tie up
this is a very pretty blouse the fabric is lightweight and very soft i read the other reviews and this does run very small i ordered two sizes larger than i normally would and it fits very nicely
i was hesitent to order this was worried it would be too shapeless im glad i ordered it as it is light and flowy though not so much that it makes you look like a shapeless tent the colors are vibrant and the smooth fabric feels good against your skin it is lined i had no issues with the bust im c i wish it were an inch longer im 
i love this denim jacket its just a basic light denim jacket with a casual preworn soft feel i like how its slightly cropped i think it runs fairly truetosize possibly a little on the small side i am lbs and c and i ordered a medium for a more relaxed fit if i had wanted the fit shown on the model i would have ordered a small but i prefer jackets to be a bit looser i love it
the fabric is beautiful a bit sheer but overall lovely however the sizing is really off fyi c broad shouldersback my usual size in a fitted top this one is very fitted in the waist and bust is a i tried the and and the side zipper wouldnt come near closing it is very very nipped right under the bust so if you have no bustline and a super small waist this top is for you if you are like me high waist and straight up and down this is a pass in fact it is really h
i love it the fit is very flattering i read in another review that the top runs small so i got a small instead of an extra small and it fits perfectly
this is such a lovely top and i am so happy i was able to snag it on sale trust the other reviewers that it does run small i am normally a or on top and i got the and its a bit snug it is very fitted below the bust but thats what makes it look so nice on i would definitely recommend but know that sizing is off
i bought the black leggings and love how warm and comfy they are i wore them with a tunic and boots to work and people were surprised that they were leggings the ribbing makes them nicer than plain black leggings i want another pair especially for the price
this dress was gifted to me and is a perfect compliment to the holidays i cant wait to wear it the bottom portions shines i am a devoted lover of all things sparkle and shine but it really stands out with the darker background the pleats hide imperfections in body shape and would make a flattering dress on most figures i also like that the top layer extends below the bottom one leaving little extra sheer to tastefully show more leg
i love this skirt as a fan of different textures and pretty things this piece exceeded my expectations i am always a size or in retailer dresses and the fits like a glove the length is perfect just above the knee ever since i wore a valentino dress with a similar thick neoprene material ive adored the feel of it everything feels firm and put together the colors in this skirt are beautiful and the pattern is feminine and romantic it will pair well with lots of different tops too
this dress is just so beautiful i purchased the teal with beading at the hem the beading is subtle and beautiful im wearing this do a spring wedding even though i believe it would be best in cooler months i so wanted the plum option with the flower aplique at the hem wouldnt that be perfect for the spring wedding but all gone note the teal with the beading the beading weighs a bit enhancing the lines of the dress doesnt stick out doesnt make you look like your wearing a dr
dd in tops in bottoms bought size ml very cute pattern on the grey leggings and the fleece lining is warm they are thick too so even stretched they are not see through i would say would be as large as these bottoms would fit as they are snug but fine for wearing under skirts and dresses
beautiful dress the dress appears more blue in the picture it is actually green made well i love it
these leggings are so warm and comfortable theyre thick enough to wear as pants and they dont stretch and slide during the day i wish they came in more colors
im a sucker for beaded detailing so i couldnt resist this blouse its so beautiful and fun i cant wait to wear it
love this topgot it in both orange and white and always get compliments especially on the orange color beautiful and vibrant color very comfy top and washes well with no problems the style does swing but not too huge
im about lbs and tall and usually a small would be my size these fit but i would be more comfy in a m they are stretchy soft and opaque perfect for under a couple sweater dresses i picked up by retailer will be reordering
i really love these leggings the different textures that all the colors have make them interesting quality is great i am and lbs the sm fit pretty well but i wish there was a xs option but still would not hesitate to buy again i actually went to retailer tonight to purchase all the other colorsthats how happy i am with this purchase
 for super comfy warm leggings bought two pairs for myself and another pair for my mother lets be honest ill probably be buying another pair
love these leggings soft cozy and yummy feeling cant wait for the weather to get cooler these fleecelined leggings will be a new staple this winter
i bought this to wear to and english garden themed party and i loved it for this event it is very bright maybe even more than the pictures if thats possible and the skirt is was long on my frame so i had to get it it hemmed several inches so that it didnt give the s housewife look it was comfortable and i the skirt had just enough poof to make me feel great i could wear a regular bra but not sure where else im going to wear this but im going to try to come find another event worthy
these are the best leggings i have ever worn and i wear a lot of leggings i am tall and lbs i bought a sm they very soft and warm they stay up perfectly and do not pinch or make any lines i am amazed that they are so inexpensive i am buying more after this review
i purchased this dress for a black tie optional wedding in the mansions of rhode island it was comfortable and appropriate i received so many compliments from strangers wonderfully twirling dress for dancing too
i love this dress even more beautiful in person 
these leggings are awesome quality especially for the price they are warm and form fitting they are thick and the design is nice i plan on wearing them all winter
these leggings are amazing by far one of the most comfortable pairs that i own i should have ordered more i got a ml and they fit perfect the detailing is awesome and they even stay opaque when you sit so you dont have to worry about them being seethrough great buy
i loved the look of these jeanssuper cutehowever they were way too tight i ordered my usual size they dont fit like a darker pair of serif jeans i own back they go id be curious if anyone else found these to run smaller
i love this skirt i wasnt sure about the mix of the back pattern with the front but it works it is great for work at a less conservative place and for dinners out too the quality is great the skirt is a fine silk ant it is lined so you dont need a slip i think it fits perfectly for my body type and while it runs big compared to typical retailer sizing it is true to size compared to other stores in the petite sizes anyway i am normally a petite waist hips 
great leggings for the price they are ultra soft and stretchy a great pair of leggings to relax in they are very stretchy and only come in sizes sm lxl i am tall and they fit fine because usually such generic sizing is too large for my small frame they are a bit long for a petite person but tucked into boots and nobody will know
and runs large im always a size in dresses and the was too big i would buy it in a if the color was closer to what im seeing online
i was expecting these to be the normal thickness of everyday leggings plus fleece instead theyre more like thickerthanaverage tights still warm though theres a weird seam on the inside of the thighs that takes away from some of the comfort not so bad that i want to return them but not what i was hoping for either
i never buy printsbut this was so understated and elegant i could not resist just received and it is lovely beautiful soft hues with the softest of pattern that will look fantastic with jeans the buttons are beautiful and a special touch will be wearing this top oftenpretty soft fabric comfortable fit and a goes with everything and everywhere piece a must get i wear a medium and ordered my usual size and it fits beautifully love reminds me of a monet watercolor
my husband rarely seems this pleased and he always likes to see what i try on oohs and aaaahs galore with this one lets let him review this onehe says he loves the vibrant color length and the way the top is perfectly fitted he was impressed with the lining and the mesh at the hem that keeps the flare in the skirt i had to explain that one he likes the way it looks with a sweater and without and said that i could use more than one of the many pairs of shoes with it that he sees
these are the best leggings they were so comfortable that i wore them all day and then to bed i didnt want to take them off im hoping to get a few more pairs
i have these in grey and i love them they are so comfy i got them in ml even though i am a sm because i like the loose fit they are very soft
so much to love about this dress the color is exactly as pictured in the video not photos the fabric is substantial beautiful colors the dress is well constructed back zipper and is easy to put on and take off it is not only lined but has a crinoline built in to the liner its not super puffy just enough to give it some flare i am b lbs and bought a it fits me perfectly the shoulders are a smidge too big but not enough for me to have them taken up just yet oh and i
i needed a legging to wear with boots makes sense that if it is cold enough to wear boots in socal then it is too cold to wear thin leggings try to find warm leggingsalmost impossible until retailer put fleece lined leggings in their catalogue the leggings have a vertical knitted stripe which elongates the leg and they are warm perfection in garments is very rare but these leggings are hot
these are great jeans and worth every penny they hug every curve and have just enough give in the places that you need them i find them to be very figureflattering and dressed them up with high heeled boots and a nice blouse even though im petite i ordered a regular in my size because i wanted the length of regular jeans as opposed to ankle length
really comfortable great for casual event or everyday wearing best style with jeans
love the leggings very soft and comfortable i ordered two pair one sm and one ml the sm fit better on me but both will work
these pants are so warm and cozy and comfortable they are like cashmere for your legsso amazingly soft and for that price its definitely worth getting all the colors
i wanted these leggings to wear under dresses during winter to keep my legs warm they get the job done and for an incredible price they are soft and lined with fleece on the inside im not sure the ribbing on the black is necessary but its subtle and i dont mind it they are a tad long on my petite frame but since i intend to tuck them into boots the length not a problem my only quibble is that my first pair arrived with three snags on one leg retailer kindly sent me a new pair for
love how these fit they are warm and such a good price i got pairs i washed mine in a garment bag and it washed just fine i hung them dry
truly the only word that comes to mind when i think of this dress is dazzling the pictures online just barely do it justiceif you have an retailer nearby check to see if its available in store and go check it out in person it does not disappoint every year around this time our beloved retailer seems to come out with this style of dress in the years past they have all been different and beautiful but i think they have truly outdone themselves this year this dress is a deep emerald green
really comfortable leggings not see through and at a great price
these are my new favorite leggings they have everything i need soft waist band that doesnt squeeze me at all not overly long subtle ribbed texture black pair that make them feel just a little nicer and most importantly they are not see thru at all so soft on the inside too and this price is nuts too im so happy with these
i bought this in the green and i had to try a few to get one that sat well in fact i tried on a size above my normal size and that particular dress was shorter and tighter than my normal size when i reordered my normal size it was a pretty good fit i kept the dress but am still on the fence on whether or not i should actually keep it it took so long to find one that fit well that it missed the holiday events where id hoped to wear it
these leggings are a quality product at a great price i ordered these for my daughter and she loves them warm and comfy she wears them all the time
these are super comfy and a great fitting everyday short the embroidery gives them a nice touch i am ordering another pair
ive worn this dress to two summer weddings and i couldnt be happier with it this dress is extremely flattering i usually wear a size but i returned the dress for a size which fit perfectly the exact same dress but in a different color was being sold at another major store the other color wasnt nearly as flattering but still cute and the price was comparable
i bought this dress in the store and realized that it was a little too long for my frameim i then found it online in the same size but in petite and it fits perfectly i got a ton of compliments and i wore it to a holiday wedding and am planning on wearing it to several other occasions over the holidays would def recommend this dress
liked everything about these but they should say in the description that theyre ribbed
i couldnt believe the bargain price of these leggings so i took a chance and ordered all colors when they arrived i was equally pleased to see how soft cozy and warm they were and how nice they looked with all my oversized tops also interesting is that the textures of all are different the black has a vertical lined texture the lavender has a cable weave texture and the gray is untextured wearing them is going to be a pleasure
loved this dress fit like a glove so flattering and perfect for a summerfall wedding material is substantial and dress is well made im large chest and curvy and a size fit perfectly longer than seen on the model for me but i actually love it being tealength a strip of tulle attached to the lining underneath the skirt to help it poof i removed it but looks good either way
i think the shirt is supposed to be a relaxed fit but i could have definitely gone down a size
from quality to design and overall comfortthese leggings have it all they are so so soft and feel and look amazing on i bought the black and i love the ribbed detailing its just enough to add a little something i ended up buying the other two colors and another pair of black for the price its more than worth it
just got this top in the mail today and i love it i bought the white in a small and it fits as pictured on the model the fabric says its cotton but its a substantial fabric and feels as soft as silk the bodice is lined so no bra lines show through the tiered part of the tank is not lined but is not really sheer or seethrough the arm holes are not too large as sometimes happens on me when i wear sleeveless tops i think ill be wearing this one a lot this summer and a lot of summers
i normally stay away from dresses like these because they have a tendency to make my tall hourglass frame look like i had one too many burgers however i saw one left in the store and was drawn in by its color and beautiful sequins my thoughts below pros exactly as pictured i got the purple option but i did see another lady grab the green both are beautiful in different ways like another mentioned the sequins on the bottoms gives some weight to the dress but in a g
i love this skirt it does run a little small i ordered an extra small and it is tight at the waist but still works i have received more compliments on this skirt than maybe anything i have owned ive been stopped at the grocery store by people telling me how much they like it i also work with kids and they all love it as well
these are fabulous leggings for cold days i am a teacher who has to do crossing guard duty in the mornings and finally i have something stylish that also keeps me warm love them and i highly recommend only con is that they are about of an inch shorter than i would like
so soft comfortable and warm i ordered the black and think ill buy the grey and lavender as well the material is a little syntheticalmost shiny looking but definitely not a deal breaker these are my new lounge pants recommend
i get so many compliments when i wear this colors are great and print is unique perfect for fall
this dress fits to a t true to size very flattering fabric is soft and comfortable
this dress is absolutely gorgeous every time i wear it people just dont stop admiring it great material and great fit
love the block appearance looks exactly like on the model material again could have been better dry clean only so expensive wear price per wear may be high due to that as each time you dry clean price actually goes up and use goes down
this is a cute jacket nice materials comfortable and feels very well made i read some reviews about sizing and went with a small when i am usually an xs or s the small was too big and boxy feeling i think i would have liked it better if it felt like a more tailored fit the design is definitely different and i played around with the collar drape thing but it felt a little awkward to me overall i think its a cute jacket but i sent it back not for me
i loved this top but it runs small so i had to send it back unfortunately beautiful styling and color blocking just wish there had been a larger size available to have been able to exchange for
light but cozy enveloping sweater ive worn this with an evening outfit as well as to a preschoolers birthday party it is an odd cut but now that i have figured it out it is an easy piece to throw on and look put together tons of compliments every time i wear it it is quite long im so it would work for someone taller too
im a c and lbs i bought this jacket in m and it fits perfect the sleeves are just the right length it fits through the chest and hips the leather and other material is super soft i love the dark brown color its just as pictured like someone else said you can tuck the hanging material inside the jacket for a sleeker look this is my new favorite jacket
i am in love with this dress ordered online in both my usual and i go back and forth and this time i kept the six there is a little bit of stretch to the fabric but it has nice structure and the cap sleeves make it a welcome addition to my wardrobe i plan on wearing this as a daytonight dress since its appropriate for work and for an evening out
this jacket is stunning the vegan leather has a slight shimmer the waterfall fabric is nice and soft its really beautiful and unique cropped jackets tend to shorten me but the cascading waterfall fabric add a nice little bit of length that just balances the jacket nicely the sleeves in the xxsp petite size that i tried on were tight they were better in the xsp but i wont be wearing any thick sweaters underneath it fit everywhere else im usually an xxsp and sized up for the arms ove
this jacket is phenomenal the color is gorgeous in person the brown has a unique shimmer to it that just makes it feminine and special its also very warm and comfortable like some other reviewers said it looked great zipped as well as unzipped this is a really special find and great addition if youre considering this jacket i say go for it for reference i actually love the fit and thought it was tts though i am a c and got this in a small so perhaps thats only the case for c cup a
was so excited to see that this colorful top came in petite sizes it fits perfectly and so happy that it doesnt fall too long looks great with a longer cardigan sweater very happy with this find 
i love the colors and pattern on this dress and its nice that it has a lining so no slip needed the cut works perfectly for my big booty figure however im pretty small up top and the neckline comes pretty low so i either have to wear my craziest pushup bra or get the top altered i havent decided what my plan is yet but will keep the dress for sure
i purchased this dress in the blue version its a lovely dress that would be perfect for summer the dress fit tts on me it is a little low in the neck area and it is a little uncomfortable in the torso area i am on the fence about keeping it the skirt is flouncy cute and fun i hope i can get it to work
love love this top fabric is nice and soft looks great with leggings love the way it falls in the front an long enough in the back
 lbs d normally size i picked this up on a whim to try on and i am glad i did it is very flattering on my curvy frame it does run a big big so i sized down to a instead of my normal size the top is still a tad bit big as another commented not enough that i would need to have it altered but enough that i probably wouldnt wear it to work without a cami under it over all i love this dress its very flattering and flirty and it makes me feel pretty i bought the orange motif
love the skirt colors are nice fabric is thick enough to go to fall but not too thick for summer ti is short so has room the colors are somewhat brighter in person but not summer bright more fall bright not sure htat makes sense love the flower pattern it is pretty but strong at the same time now on to fit the waist is the small part my usual was snug on the waist but the skirt was perfect everywhere else not sure about sizing up yet as it may flare out too much will g
i love this tank super soft and comfy i wear with leggings jeans shorts anything longer in the back so will cover your butt at least it covered mine runs slightly oversized love the asymmetry in the front very flattering very happy with it
i ordered a size and an based on the review that said that the piece ran small i fit both skirts but chose the size as it was a bit looser at the hip and the length was better funny thoughthe pockets on both skirts were sewn at very uneven areas on both neither skirt had usable pockets as they were sewn shut at half inch intervals on one skirt and very uneven intervals on the other i liked the idea of pockets which is one reason i ordered itit is described as having side poc
i am lb and i usually wear a or in tops because i dont like clothing too tight on top i took a chance and got the xl because it was all that remained now i wish i could be more please bring this back retailer
i saw this dress in the store window and gave it a try i found it to be super flattering and feminine the bodice is form fitting and the skirt flares out to a full skirt the colors are fun and vibrant the neckline is a bit low for work but perfect for evening it is true to size
some quick notes it is not sheer like a previous poster was asking there is a lining the color is darker than it appears online which was ok with me i thought it still looked nice as a deeper gold i was excited about this top and thought it was the perfect thing for a casualfestive company holiday party i ordered a m and am usually between m and s in most retailer items unfortunately it fit me rather boxy and short i have a larger bust g and it draped in a very unflattering way m
i bought this dress in the orange and it is great for summer even though i am normally a smallsize at lbs i opted for the because i am busty d this was the right call the dress is comfortable flattering and i got lots of compliments its a keeper
the dress has an awesome fit and the perfect length its easy to make it more classy with a summer cardigan
cute bright colored suit a little more orange than pink i prefer pink but the fit didnt quite work for me the bottoms were a little too big and the top although was fairly well proportioned just didnt look right altogether purchase the extra smalls in both and have since returned i do love the suits that retailer has been offering would just love to be able to try them on in the store nice quality good colors
i didnt notice what some of the other reviews have said i think its very flattering makes my waist look tiny and the flouncy skirt is a lot of fun it is low cut in the bust but not crazy im a modest person and im comfortable with it what i like best however it the cut of the top it is wide enough at the arms to cover any armpit bulge the fabric is very light and soft and the colors are vibrant and fun it does run a tad large i can go between a and in most retailer dresses and got
as soon as i saw this skirt i was in love i like the fit it is very comfortable i love the detail in the crocheted part of the skirt i cant wait to wear it and i recommend this item
love this dress sadly it ran so large that it was literally falling off of me because i bought it on sale the option wasnt there to buy a smaller one the quality is excellent and its perfect for a spring or summer day in miami sorry to have had to return it due to the sizing issue
great top for everyday wear runs a little large as i usually for size medium and i bought a small a tiny bit see through but i think i can get away without wearing a tank underneath
everyone else who reviewed felt the dress fit quite odd i have an oddly shaped body so this dress was perfect on me the bigger bodice fit on my large broad rounded upper body skimmed my true waist and flared out to complimentary skirt that wasnt too twee the silhouette evens out my odd figure the fabric is a gorgeous pinkorangeteal pattern on comfortable cotton i do have to agree with the lowness of the neckline its a bit immodest i wear my cropped denim jacket and a simple la
this skirt is worth every penny it appears slightly different than pictured in terms of color it is a creamblue gray making it very versatile the crochet work is beautiful and cream it is not too bright to show every dirt mark the cream coordinates perfectly with the leather color it is a classic elegant design and could be paired with a silk type or even a cashmere sweater in the cooler months to come for me it is tts mostly i am usually a and the six fits perfectly it has an
these are the best tights last year i bought these and they went back to regular waistband this year the best waistband tights are best
the color of these shorts is even more beautiful and vibrant in real life the detail is wonderful and they are so comfortable
i saw this initially in the store and thought it was nice but did not purchase because i thought the price was too high i saw it again and it was on sale but the store had sold out of my size i checked online and my size was available so i ordered i was afraid this cape would be to long and make me look frumpy but it wasnt and i didnt it looked great i tie the belt a little higher than the model to make me look taller i cant wait to wear it on cool fall days
this is a very lovely sweater dress it looks just as pictured and true to size i ordered mine online and was very happy with this purchase the material of the top white portion is very soft and cozy and bottom peach chiffon material has sparkly stones sweater dress is very pleasant on the skin and looks refreshing recommend
everything about this jumper is lovely the color the fit the fabric corduroy anything rules but the first day i wore it the zipper was a problem it was missing a tooth my husband helped me work around that to zip it up for a sunday drive i unzipped to nurse our baby and then we couldnt get it back up and it just separated leaving me half dressed in the restaurant was going to have it repaired but will send back now that i see they have more i dont know about yall but i always feel a
very comfortable and love the color im a bit curvier on the bottom and the small still fit me fine
this will be my third pair of hei hei shorts i was very pleased with the previous two shorts sand city short and dobby beach comber all shorts have nice materials and not too tight perfect for the summer i typically wear s or m depending with the material and design i bought size s and it fits nicely
the jeans are the perfect highwaisted jeans they do not stretch out and fit perfectly the perfect length for a heel love them all year round
when i saw this sweater online i ordered literally immediately as i was afraid that is would sell withing an hour i am shocked that it is not sold out when i received it in the mail it is even prettier in person the pink tulle peplum is actually more of a taupe giving the sweater a more sophisticated look the sweater is soft and cozy and the peplum is such a beautiful and elegant touch i wore with silver flats and jeans and wow got so many compliments runs spot on true to size and is a
i got this in the grey and wore it the day i opened the package one side is see through so i wore a camisole underneath its lightweight and not at all clingy i normally like my shirts in medium and this was true to size for me perfect sweater for a fall day in new england
ive been trying to find a pair of tasteful destroyed jeans for the summer im also petite i love paige jeans already since the ankle length has worked very well on me i saw these jeans in store tried them on and loved them like other paige jeans they dont stretch out especially if you size down but even then you dont get that sausage feeling of wearing pants that are too small the material stretches in the waste
love these i am a medium in shorts or and the medium fit perfectly true to size very soft flattering cut and color love the embroidery great for travel very light and can be jazzed up a little with nice sandals almost like a flirty little short skirt the fullness and non fitted look is great for a less than perfect tummy i am very happy with this purchase
really cute and comfortable i have worn these a couple of times and get several compliments worth every penny and now they are on sale
i am b small waist wide hips dress fits perfectly a little longer than i had expected hits about midcalf on me great quality corduroy nice medium green color very unique sort of vintage feel piece
this poncho is dreamy the colors are divine and appear a little bolder in person there is a gorgeous leather trim around the edges that elevates the look so much the belt minimizes how big the poncho is and really makes it feminine its everything you dream of when it comes to a third layer for fall my only gripe is that the fabric is a little itchy it being wool i cant say that im surprised and the truth is that its heavy enough that you would definitely be wearing long sleeves underneat
unlike one comment below a review on here who stated it felt childish i didnt feel this way at all im a sucker for anything white with tulle and soft colors and a bit of bling heres my thoughts pros very soft with good amount of stretch tulle bottom is exactly as pictured i disagree with another reviewer who said the color was more of taupe it is not this is pinknude shade all the way runs tts im a c hourglass and found the medium to be
these shorts are great for warm weather they look great with a navy top the pattern is very attractive they are on the baggy side but the style is very flattering
love the interesting patterns and slightly oversized fit perfect for a relaxed day with a cami skinnies and sneakers what i dont like is the materials used to make this sweater im concerned laundering will shrink and i will lose the drape or it will be too short the perforated part is truly see through so yes wear an under or over layer
i love the texture and sheen of corduroy combined with this beautiful evergreen color i purchased size and the somewhat stretchy fit accommodates my bust size dd with a blouse or slim fitting sweater quite well i think the skirt flares out too much and ends a little too low for my height so im waiting for the petite to arrive to see if its more flattering i picked tts but may be a bit large for those who are less busty so you may want to size down if youre slender or pear shaped
i tried it in the store but was not the true size so i ordered online i wore it only once so far and got lots of compliments very unique design
this is so much nicer in person wore this out todaynow that it isnt too too cold fashionable and warm love the clasp quite genius i am a c and while id normally take a small got this in medium and it fits perfectly id say this piece runs slightly small for retailer
i loved this dress im and wore the small and even in heels it was a bit long i have a larger chest double d and the chest was slightly snug but otherwise fit perfectly i got compliments from everyone gorgeous dress
simple pullon pant with a great design they look flattering on and can easily be dressed up i wear between a and and the small fit perfect i have washed them and worn them several times and they still seem good as new the wide elastic waistband ensures that they stay in place
this dress is incredible let me say that when it first arrived i was terrified that i looked like a got tangled in my grandmas curtain the print was really overwhelming for my living room however i went with my gut and wore this dress for our engagement photos out in the woods not only was in incredibly flattering it photographed better than i could have imagined wouldnt recommend wearing this grocery shopping but this is a perfect for a special occasion
i tried this on left went back put it on hold then finally took the plunge i had a hard time justifying the price not really a functional coat too warm to be a shirt but so unique i had to have it i got the sm boxy in a good way got it yesterday with the antro members off
i love this shimmer tankin both colors it is a very thin fabricthinner than i would have expected but i think this is okay since i would use it for layering and probably never wear it as a standalone tank i think you can never go wrong with sparkles especially in a layering tankit dresses up or fancies up the outfit the straps on this tank are not adjustable and if you are large chested i think a lot of cleavage would show in this tank i would have preferred the sleeves are very sligh
i was hesitant to buy this due to the price but so i glad i did when it came in the mail great quality and surprisingly thick silky fabric very comfortable and the shimmery thread detail is beautiful could be very warm in the summer due to the thick tweed like fabric fits and looks true to size just like it does on the model
i adore this top lovely color fit is very flattering can dress up for work with a skirt or down with jeans
i purchased this in both colors the neutral and grey i love them both but the grey is by far my fave this is a nice soft beautiful tee the burst of flowers are just adorable i found these ran tts on me cute little top and such a good deal at sale price
nice quality fabric thats soft to the touch lightweight and lays smoothly runs small great for those of us who are small on top the s fits like xs longer length but not tunic length the navy can pass for dark silvergray
i like that the top is lightweight and very comfortable and is flattering i can see wearing this over the holidays for entertaining it looks festive and pretty something easy to pop on and look pulled together in a flash
vibrant lovely and quite long this maxi works for leggy bettys i stand in my stocking feet and the dress hem grazed the floor not quite as voluminous as the photo suggests but stunning nonetheless runs a bit small i normally wear xs to s and i tried a xs instore but it fit just eversoslightly too snug i didnt try a size s but i suspect it may have fit eversoslightly too large
i like the idea of a skort and how it is different than everything else out there this skort is a bit dressyperfect for a summer party or drinks on the patio at a city cafe i love that it has pockets the fabrics used in the patchwork are quality and the tailoring is nice it fit me true to size i cant wait for warmer weather to wear it
in love with this dress so feminine and lovely makes you feel beautiful the fabric flow and construction of this dress is stunning and flattering i am ftin and lbsbought the xs and it fit perfectly in the waist but is a bit snug in my not so large bust area however the s was too large and did nothing to accentuate my waist and changed the whole look of the dress on me cannot wait to wear this dress but it is so long needs to be altered itll be worth it
cute summervacation dress lightweight material but not flimsy im normally a xss and i ordered the s petite which was right bc i think the xs would have been too clingy looking the regular length would also have been too long
cute top somewhat sheer but color and fit are great fits slim but true to size
these pants are wonderful they are very flattering the color is gorgeous and they are incredibly comfortable got tons of complements
gorgeous soft colors that can be worn with many things lightweight fabric with beautiful detailed finish to the neckline i purchased at my local retailer store along with the baroque tee that i purchased in a smaller size because of the differences in the design of the two shirts highly recommend both
this top is perfectly feminine the fabric is light and the bow adds that perfect touch of distinction
this seems like a simple tank but the shape of it is super flattering it kind of soles in at the seam and the shoulders are just adorable and sexy at the same time i love the detail in the straps coloring is neutral enough adn the fabric is very soft i am glad i finally tried it on jsut didnt want t pay full price but broke down as sizes are selling out smaller sizes i am usually xs petite and that is gone so is xxs so went with xs i am lbs and dd for reference
flattering cut the tie neck is very nice but definitely needed the petite for me regualr size went too low the striping is a nice flowey thin fabric in grey and navy with a bit of texture in ti not sure it is obvious from the picture length in eptite went right below my knee but in a goood spot overall loved it but returned in hopes it hits sales one day jsut spending too much latetly
the dress is gorgeous material is soft great design but runs at least one size small and very long im and even with in heels its way to long alteration needed
far more attractive in person than online earlier reviews are all accurate very flattering and quality manufacturing the scarf bow makes it so distinctive
beautiful tee and cut with a classic simple silhouette nice weight and true to size im and the small fits me like i like not tight at all with room to allow for shrinkage i really appreciate the higher cut of the neck as most tees i have purchased last several years i love for the overall fit and material but am a little selfconscious in due to the low cut neck maybe if i werent as small chested this wouldnt be an issue for me i definitely recommend this tee
this is just a really fun jacket agreed with the previous reviewer that its not the most functional but guess what this is super cozy its lined with the softest faux fur its quilted in an army green and it has the best trim along the arm they couldve cut corners on the quality here for instance with the beading or the material on the trim however they didnt cut those corners instead the jacket feels incredibly well made and feels very expensive cant wait till the weather g
i wanted to love this dress and i dont it is soft it is flattering on the model and sits comfortably on the shoulders until you move the heaviness of the shoulders pulls the fabric back causing the drape along the bottom to look odd and unflattering so sad i wore it to lunch with my husband but felt like i was constantly pulling the shoulderssleeves back into place i wont pull it from my closet to wear again very often
i wanted to love this but my hips interfered it is a little on the short side also as one previous reviewer noted and is definitely made for a straight figure beautiful details on the shoulder and could definitely see this as a staple in my closet if the fit was right sadly it was returned
i cannot believe this tshirt is on sale the colors and the design are beautiful and soft the shirt is an average tshirt weight and the fit is nice and loose on the body like it is on the models i am with a petiteathletic build and the xs fits comfortably with some roomwashing may make it even more perfect i cannot wait to wear this with jeans on the weekends or with a grey skirt to work
i really try to avoid hand washing so i immediately checked the label when i found this dress instore and despite the fact that retailer lists this as hand wash online the label says machine wash it also says lay flat to dry so i was happy about that i tried this in xs regular first photo with camisole which was too lowcut and then ordered the xspetite in the second photo im a aa lbs which was better higher vneck mainly and shorter length although i couldve gone with eit
the dress is beautiful it is very long romantic and feminine i am and it touches the ground i tried on an xl normally i am a l and today i wore a size m retailer dress to work and i could not even begin to zip the xl dress the arms were fine i think i would need sizes higher i am so sad because it is so beautiful
these are so comfortable i love how they fit snug but have tons of stretchthis is my second pair of fleetwood from coh love this style
what a fabulous find i purchased the grey and it looks great with different shades of blue jeans i am lbs and wear a size c and the medium fits wonderful was worried it would run short as i am long waisted but fits just a bit shorted then pictured i love tucking the front in and letting the back hang out
i tried the gray pattern on in the store and it is very soft and pretty the fabric has a nice drape to it however the length was too long on me so i came online to find it in petite but most of the petite sizes are sold out in the gray i shop at retailer because i like it that so many of their styles are available in petite however the petite length sizes seem to sell out much faster than the regular sizes i hope retailer will give us short girls a break and order more petite length sizes so
very cute skort that fits tts great length for us middle aged women as well love the hidden front pockets and the modern color block design my only issue is the side zipper gets stuck right where the waistband starts im assuming this is because of the thicker fabric around the waistband i usually try to wait for the sale prices but i think this skort will sell out well before then
was actually looking for something completely different and then walked into this dress i have already a few events lining up for the summer months and i could see this working on those hot summer days im short and curvy so i tried on the large in store im busty and ended up ordering the petite l online the top part fits proportion wise better with petite while a l gives my larger bust size enough room i love the length i feel a great length when youre only will look great wi
i love this tee so much i bought in every color available i have received so many compliments on each one so soft and comfortable and easy care
i love this piece and have bought it for three different clients as well as myself it runs a size larger i am usually a and the fits perfectly the skort was one size off for my clients too definitely a great choice for springsummer especially if you love to dress up but lead an active lifestyle
love the dress its beautiful and flowy and makes you feel like a princess when you wear it also very versatile as it can be worn in multiple seasons and dressed up or dressed down love everything about the dress and know that it will become a staple in my closet runs true to size xs and s if you are short be prepared to have the hem taken up worth the buy
i ordered this dress for my engagement photos and i am so excited to wear it its a gorgeous dress a bit fancy it drapes so nicely on the body as previous reviews have stated its a little snug in the chest and shoulders so you might want to size up i typically wear a size in dresses and fairly small chested and i decided to stick with the small in this dress i probably would have been a little more comfortable in a medium as its a little tight in the shoulder area still overall thou
i love this top i purchased the gray simply because i felt it would go with more i can pair it with blue jeans my pink pilcro chinos and even my turquoise pilcro shorts i love that this tee doesnt have the rolled sleeves so its a little more finished looking i tried on both the small and medium and both fit but i preferred the tapered fit of the small and ultimately went with that for reference im lbs d chest i do think is hefty for a tshirt so you could roll the
love this dress so so much the wearability of it isnt much since its such a wow dress but if you have a wedding that it would be fitting for itso perfect if it were a touch shorter id be happy wearing it to the park id suggest hemming if you want to make it more casual buy why go there when its so stunning long the sales associates in store kept telling me i looked like a princess although that may have been my doing as i kept twirling for them saying look how cool this is 
i would absolutely recommend this dress if you have the right body type
i love this dress it is so much fun to wear to the beach or out to lunch the arm holes are a little large so i wear s tank underneath
super soft cap sleeves shirt tail hem and double stitched seams mine is the greygreen motif and tts i bought s b and the fit was perfect the tee can transition into fall as i feel it has a more fall appeal over summer because of the greygreen motif the bluepink motif feels more like summer
this is a very lovely tshirt because of the color and design it has a very nice shape as well as the sides are not just straight across its perfect for leaving it untucked the petite fits really well no too long or too short my only complaint is the the material while really soft is also quite thin so im not sure how durable it is
i liked the idea of the scarf tie so i tried on this top in the store it was so cute on that i ignored that it was a bit overpriced for the quality the material is more of a tshirt with elastic at the bottom so it poofs a bit rather than laying flat im not sure how durable the fabric is its still really flattering and the scarf color adds a bit of a pop to the navy color i think ti would look great with jeans but with the right pants i could dress it up a bit and wear it to work it
i was hesitant to purchase since this price is expensive for a tank but the quality and true shimmeryness are worth it it fits very well and goes with many different sweaters very happy with my purchase
i ordered two sizes up after reading reviews and added a belt for waist definition it is longi am six feet tall and it is perfect for me this is absolutely beautiful my husband loves the floral print and i received countless compliments after one wear the light flowing material swayed and billowed in the breeze of the outdoor wedding i attended very feminine and enjoyable to wear pricey but i felt i could wear spring through autumn love 
wore these to church and stayed cool without being scandy i havent worn skorts since the s and this was such a nice return to that trend 
this is one of those pieces that are timeless special and absolutely stunning the body of the jacket is quilted very boxy and the embroidery and beading on the jacket is what makes it absolutely gorgeous the inside of the jacket is this super soft incredible fleecy fur it adds to the luxury of the jacket in regard to fit its very boxy if you live near an retailer i would highly recommend popping in to try it on i personally wish it was a smudge longer but i think the detail and style of
i have discovered that im really picky about tshirts its hard to find a cute flattering one that you can wear with whatever this one is perfect the neckline is different the sleeves are short almost cap sleeves it fits nicely everywhere i am an and the medium fit well i love that its a dark enough color and not sheer why are so many of your clothes see through retailer so i dont have to layer something under it just to wear it its thin enough that you can wear it in
i love this dress it is so flattering and comfortable i am petite with curves and feel so good when wearing this i ordered a petite small i will have to stop myself from wearing it every day this summer
dont pass this one up ladiesthe fabric is casual and relaxed but the drawstringlike collar gives it class and flirt all at the same time i paired it with a jersey mini skirt and the way the banding at the waist falls on this top made it look like one whole dress i can wear this with cropped jeans shorts anything truly a homerun im lbs and small fit perfectly
this dress makes me feel like the princess of fall it is very slimming the colors are much brighter in real life they look pastel here but are more pronounced love this dress
love this dress very flattering material is thinner and more lightweight than i was imaging but it is great it really does run small like the other reviewers said glad i ordered one size up fits perfectly
nice tshirt the print is very nice and the fabric is soft and flowing i love the baseball cut it gives it a different look
this is cuter in person than online the scarf goes all the way around the neck and ties on the side as the halter the whole top is soft like a tshirt material there is an elastic band at the bottom but its not too cinched so it wont cut into your waist it just gives it a little bit of shape its a cute way to show off some shoulder this summer in a lightweight fabric im looking forward to wearing it out at night with nice jeans or during the day outside a good price for retailer
i love this shirt so much that i bought it in both colors i purchased the xs regular which fit perfectly the material is incredibly soft yet thick enough that i know it has some durability the neckline is very flattering and comes up higher than most tees but not so high that it feels constricting i also love that it is slightly tapered and comes in towards your waist at the sides and is slightly longer in the back its an absolute staple in my wardrobe now
this dress is adorable its very comfortable and so flattering the only thing is i cant understand why it is priced so high its a great dress but im just not convinced its the worth the price tag im going to watch for it to go on sale fingers crossed
i love the fit of this tee for everyday wear its forgiving on my late s mom body and looks much more stylish than the average tee my only complaint is that the fabric started pilling on the second wear otherwise the fit style and fabric weight are great it fits tts im usually a size and the small fits perfectly
i absolutely adore this set its beautifully constructed perfect for something special but comfortable enough for everyday wear i normally wear a c but got the ab and it fits perfectly my only complaint is that the longline portion tends to ride up and rest just below the underwire as there is no band holding the lace in place along the bottom still it is far and away my favourite bra and i highly recommend it
this dress is gorgeous i bought it to wear to the ballet and i know i will wear it to other formal events as well it is really fancydefinitely wouldnt wear it to work i had it hemmed as it was really long on me and it is a bit tight in the shoulders it has a beautiful shape and flows while you are walkingit felt pretty
a truly gorgeous dress ran a little too small in the shoulders for me so i had to reorder the next size up its is very long but i wont hesitate to have it altered it is stunning
i love skorts so when i saw this online i ordered my usual size arrived today really cute fit is good w some room to spare almost too big but ill stick w the looks as in the pic except the lower front part the back has a metallic sparkly fiber in the fabric not shown in the pic though its understated but attractive the fabric patches give this skort a special uniqueness casual or a little dressy just love 
love this dress beautiful
i really love this piece its so different from anything else i own the material has a lot of fine details to it that are hard to see in the photos easy to dress up with a bit of jewelry and heels the only downside is the upper body fit im and lbs with more of an hourglass shape i did not fill out the top at all although the shorts fit fine around my waist
i read all the previous reviews and wasnt sure what to think when i saw it on sale at my local retailer store i decided that despite the thin fabric it was worth getting i love the quote spoken by audrey hepburn in the movie sabrina and knew i just needed to add a cami underneath i bought it two days ago and wore it yesterday with a short sleeved open sweater so the quote showed i got two compliments on it within a short time for reference i am and lbs i bought a large and i
i love this dress saw it online and went to try it on in the store the next day this dress is perfect the pattern stands out but isnt too overwhelming im lbs and ddd i bought an xs and i love the fit its just the right amount of fabric to be flowy without being excessive one thing ive found with flowy dresses is they make you look preggers if you have a large bust however this dress is nothing of the sort seriously if you find your size in stock snatch it up
id been eyeing this skirt for quite some time so when it went in sale i took the plunge i hover between a size and though lately unfortunately its usually a haha the fit true to size perfect silhouette i will say it was more of a midi length on me than as seen on the model and im a near so for more petite girls the length might be tricky for me it was fine i liked the slightly longer length it made it even more elegant the quality was superb no missing thread
these shorts are so cute and comfortable you can wear any color top and they are very flattering they fit tts
i fell in love with this dress as soon as i saw it it does fit more loosely than i typically prefer but the colors and the patterns have such personality that it didnt matter i wear mine both as a dress and with leggings for the windy days this is one of my new favorites
really cute romper that can be dressed up or down super comfortable and flattering i ordered the xs and it fit perfect
for reference i am lbs b normally a size m i got the med and it ftt size i ordered this online and it came a bit wrinkled so im hoping once i iron it out it wont be a problem when i am wearing it i was looking for a nice flowy tuniclike shirt that was flattering but nothing too constricting this is the perfect length for me to wear with leggings which is what i was looking for it is longer in the back covers my bottom which is what i wanted and shorter in the frontthe
this dress is so pretty and the petite fits great in the arms and the length is good just above the knees the material is nice not flimsy im just not sure if it looks right on my petite straight frame the front is cute but the back is pretty baggy and shapeless ive never worn a shirt dress so im not sure if this is how its supposed to look i tried it with a belt but it doesnt seem to work with this dress as theres a band of loose elastic probably would look better on a curvier bod
this romper is one of my favorite purchases the material is great the fit is very forgiving and it is very comfortable it is easily dressed up or down i purchased a size smaller than i usually wear and it fits well
i ordered the orange color online and was very happy with the product when it arrived its a soft orange color perfect for fall the shirt is thin and probably will need a cami underneath but its longer in the back than the front and will go great with leggings or skinny jeans
the picture does not do this swing sweater any justice first of all the colors are much more vibrant in person than in the picture the description says it is a yellow motif there is absolutely no yellow in it a bit of khaki in two rows of plaid but no yellow the predominant colors are a rich maroon which is so popular this season some bright blue and salmon colors which does not come out in the picture rich and beautiful secondly the sweater is sassy on just plain fun i am
i saw this online and loved it instantly i happened to come by it in the store and tried it on it was almost perfect but sadly being busty makes the dress hang not quite as well as it could i think this might be a better dress for the less bustyless curvy but it is super cute and fun
very flattering on im lbs and took a small i love how substantial the fabric is and how slimming it looks on the only weird thing for me is getting it onyou had to step thru the opening on top there are no zippers buttons and if you have larger hips or butt it will be a challenge to get on once on it looks great and believe it or not roomy
this sweater jacket is beautiful i wasnt going to try it on because i am very sensitive to fabrics that are itchy but i am so glad i did its super soft and looks great with jeans and a tshirt i have a petite frame and it doesnt look boxy at all like some swing styles tend to do totally recommend this one
i was so skeptical about ordering this its really not my style im more of a black halter dress kind of person this is so cute and flattering its well made not flimsy but is soft and pretty im and weigh i bought the small and it fits perfectly the dress hits me right above the knee in front i can see myself wearing this with cute sandals and a floppy hat at a beach bar or wearing it wiht leggings ans shooties when its cooler and dress it up with jewelry side note im
absolutely love the design fabric and fit of this dress a perfect dress for many occasions one of the many reasons i love this company excellent customer service employees and of course adorable clothing would recommend buying this dress and to all the taller girls i am and lbs and this dress is still a good length no need to continuously pull down and worry about who might see your rear
i am not a onepiece body type this is the best best best romper i have ever tried on i have a large bottom and this is so forgiving due to the perfect length of shorts drapey fabric not clingy asymmetrical cut of the top highly recommend
this is an adorable dress that just didnt work for me so sad i wanted to love it because the pattern is super cute i gave it stars because it is very pretty and i can see it working on others
on shopping trips i try to try on at least one thing that i like but dont think will look that great on me this dress was that item today not only did i like it but i liked the way it looked on me im pounds and purchased the medium i loved it the clerks loved it and my very honest daughter also loved it i will wear it as a dress and also as a tunic over skinny jeans
i absolutely loved the print on this shirt and as soon as i saw in the catalog i knew i had to have it the velvet is beautiful and the pattern is even more rich in person unfortunately the shirt is very thin much thinner than id expect with velvet and is so short that it is more like a crop top even with the shoulders pulled down for the off the shoulder look the front of the shirt hit me barely below my navel for reference im only i would buy this over again if it were only l
i am very long waisted generally a size or med but ordered the large to ensure it would not ride up and this brand has run small in the past i am keeping the large but also ordering a med to compare as i have room to spare length and width either way this is a keeper it is adorable on comfortable my tback bra works perfectly very flattering and way better than expected the shorts length is a little longer than pictured but there is an elastic waist with a cami under an
this is a great summer shirt that will also transition into the fall it is rayon so flows beautifully and feels really soft and cool against your skin it is also washable i think it looks much better in person than online i opted to have a snap added just above the top button which makes the shirt stay more closed and evenlooking as it tended to gap slightly at the top for reference i am lb but have broad shoulders making my usual best size a medium in most tops and
noticed this sweater as soon as i walked in the store i am lbs with an athletic build so teeter between a small and medium in tops i spent a long time trying to decide if i preferred the small or medium fit the sweater is a bit boxy so ended up sizing up as the longer length seems to off set some of the boxiness i am looking forward to wearing this with skinny jeans and boots as another reviewer suggested i think a denim shirt will look great underneath rated a good in quality b
i bought this instore and it is much nicer than it appears in the photos online the fabric is soft and drapey making the top lightweight and flowy this is not a fitted shirt and i didnt feel it was overly large so i think it runs true to size i felt fine in an xs t did feel the need to wear a camisole tank with it but i tend towards the modest side i bought it with the widelegged linen pants and have worn it with wedge sandals with many compliments i wish id noticed the navy blue
after having my third child i was looking for clothes to hide my tummy ive always loved the comfort of a romper but the typical cinched waist was never flattering on me this romper does not disappoint it hides areas i want hidden but does so with style i get numerous compliments whenever i wear this i cannot say enough wonderful things about this piece
this skirt is beautiful very different it wasnt all that flattering on me due to the side pockets and back pleats but all in all is a great skirt i love the design and the fabric
this jumpsuit is all the things other reviewers have stated roomy flattering has give however note the way in and out of this outfit is a single button with a loop at the top of the back if you need to run to the restroom plan it can be an absolute pain to get out of this outfit to go to the restroom lets not talk about the possibilities of the outfit dropping on a public restroom flooryes i went there i would have preferred separates to a single piece you could achieve th
cute print got lots of compliments when i wore it lightweight looks great with boots
fabulous dress for both quality and design the embroidery is gorgeous and the long sleeves make it practical to begin wearing immediately true to size and flattering looks darling with booties
retailer rarely disappoints and this jumpsuit is a perfect example i ordered a small based on reviews that it runs large and i do not like tight shorts and it was the right decision the fabric design and overall style make this piece easy to dress up or down i cant wait to wear it if you are on the fence order it now because this will not last long
love this romper it is beautifully made and classy the fabric flows and the construction is soft and solid im and and the small is a little roomy but comfortably so cant wait to where it
i found this dress on sale in store and i usually stay away from this stylecut because i have a curvier lower half but to my surprise the dress was still flowy and fit the top nicely im usually a small in tops and a on bottom but it worked for me and i get a compliment every time i wear it
ive received so many complements on this top its so comfortable and every time i wear it someone compliments the color i ordered it in each color
fell in love with this romper online but since a few reviewers mentioned it ran large i wanted to try it on in the store this romper is even better in person extremely flattering delicate details and lined its adorable i am glad i tried it on in the store i am usually a size medium but the small worked better for me i know this will be a staple of mine all spring and summer
i just got this today love it the embroidery on the front is gorgeous rich looking the material is soft has a nice weight so that it drapes perfectly is not at all see through it will look great with sandals flats or sandals with heels i wear an xs it fits tts it falls just above the knee i can see me wearing this a lot i was worried about it looking too youthfull for my age but it doesnt at all
i love this dress the pattern is fun the style is relaxed and breezy for springsummer and it is wellmade a steal at the sale price also it has pockets a huge plus for me since it is a loosefitting style i would say it run just a tad big i bought the s petite and i am lbs i couldve gone xs petite but the s fits well and looks great the pattern is stunning a great addition to my summer wardrobe i thought about pairing it with a fitted white pant but it hits me right
love this dress perfect length and i love the construction and where the seams hit not too long not too short i got so many compliments with this dress
this shirt is very flattering and drapes beautifully i am and the medium fits perfectly i bought in navy but am disappointed in the other options i would have bought all of them had they been nice colors but the yellow and orange are really garish and unflattering on any skin tone and the white way too seethrough which ruins the visual lines of the top bummer but i wear the navy every day so give that a thumbsup
sometimes swing styles dont work on me im on the busty side so they often make me look like im wearing a tent from a side view not so this sweater its more of an aline shape than a swing style and is very flattering i would think on all body types i love that it zips up and has pockets the plaid is really pretty and the overstitching detail and ribbbed bottom elevate the styling super soft too not an itch in sight dont know why they call this coloration yellow its n
i threw this into my cart online on a whim but im not disappointed and i dont even wear rompers usually for reference im and normally a size and i bought this romper in a size xs petite if youre on the shorter side i definitely recommend buying it in the petite size as i feel that this romper would run large in the regular sizes the fabric of the top drapes nicely on me and the shorts are about medium length i like the neckline details the armholes in the petite size arent
this is a pretty tunic but it just didnt look right on me the colors are nice and you can easily hide body flaws
a fun dress to just throw on go nice details in the bodice mix of blues in the prints little longer in back is nice detail for those of us who want a shorter dress but not the worry of flashing from behind
cute design the fabric drapes well conceals many possible figure flaws and has an upbeat easy vibe i got a small and am lbs and i also washed it on a short cycle on cold and put it in the dryer for minutes which worked out just fine great dress
the style and fit are excellent doesnt make you look frumpy or larger just cant get into the pattern combothe white is too stark and i feel like it was slapped on my chest like a dickey i have the paquerette and thats a mixed bag of patterns that works really well im not sure if i am keeping i may have to bleed it out to soften the white purchased size medium for my dd chest and wide rib cage
the print length and cut are all flattering i bought the other tiny dress that was similar and will buy every pattern they make
i was so pleased to see this in the store and i am glad that i had a chance to feel the knit the combination of wool cotton and nylon creates a really soft luxurious feel to the sweater i was shocked that it didnt have cashmere in the blend it is that soft but it is equally substantial this sweater can surely be worn as a piece of outerwear and it can be used as a layering piece i consider this one tts because i typically wear a m in a knit that isnt fitted i disagree with an earl
this is a great casual top that can work in all seasons i love it with skinny pantsjeans
love everything about this the length cut look etc i wear mediumlarge went with medium and it was perfect
purchased this dress at the sale price with an additional off sale not exactly sure what to expect the print is so different than my usual style preference so glad i did while the dress is way oversized for reference im lbs ordered size sm but prob should have gone with xs its stylish yet effortless today is the first day of wear at my office and already received many complements
i definitely trend towards preferring my clothes looser as a style but the fit on this dress felt a bit too boxy i typically run between and xsmall and small should have gone with the xsmall i loved the print and quality of the dress though and would recommend it
this top is gorgeous i normally wear s to m depending on brand and style ordered a s and it was so small i returned and have l on order it is cropped i am and it hit me as pictured on model if you are tall or like longer tops this may not be for you
love love this dress i got the regular size but the length is more on the petite side its shorter than what im comfortable with so will probably return it
this dress is really pretty and fun i can see where i can dress it up or tone it down subtle pretty beading at the neck just ran a bit big on me i sent back for the next size down cant wait to get it
this shirt is incredibly comfortable the material is so soft and it fits so well i am and lbs with a b chest and i purchased a small it is large on me and i would have preferred an xs but the small is just fine as well it is a great shirt especially for an oversized henley recommend one star off for the larger sizing
very cozy wrap the material is so soft find myself grabbing this anytime i am chilly day and night i offen find my daughter wrapped up in it too and with the arm holes it stays on very pleased
i almost walked past this until i saw it on the display mannequin the shimmer is very subtle but there the picture here makes hte shirt look more like a grey shirt but it is more sophisticated in person very soft fabric fitted on the wasit but romier on top cowl is super flattering usual sizze fit very nicely highly recommend i wont hev to tuck it in everytime i wear it i think it can be dressed up skirt or down jeans almost a basic t
i fell in love with these trousers as soon as i saw them online i am a big fan of essentiel antwerp their designs are unique and bold these trousers definitely fit their aesthetic the print is darker compared to the picture making the green more of a dark olive and the blue almost looks black they have an elastic waist so that helps for some of us who have a wider bottom they cinch back in once they are buttoned at the waist so it doesnt make your hips look wide the fabric is soft and
very pretty cardigan but it is huge i ordered a large normally xl or large and it is so big the shoulder seam comes to middle of my upper arm i wanted to exchange it for a medium but they are out of stock bummer
very much liked this shirt for super casual days its got a very flowy and boxy fit to it with side slits it runs a bit big compared to what it looks like on the model
im lbs with hourglassy figure and the medium was a too tight from the waste down but perfect on the top im a c pretty dress overall and looks true to color in photo but have to return
these jeans are very comfortable the distress look is enough but not too much so it is a nice change to the traditional jeans without looking too worn down
this is a great winter addition to any wardrobe warm but not hot looks great with tights as a dress or with leggings so many compliments
this top is sooo cute it does not look like pajamas as one person said it looks like a top its a bit on the boxy style so anything you want to hide below is well covered has a nice length to it is not just for lounging paired it with a black pencil skirt and it looked great i ordered the xl i am a d for reference and it hung very nicely its extremely soft and very comfy i only wish they had more colors
in accordance with other reviewers the pictures dont do this gorgeous lightweight sweater justice the fabric has threads of gold silver and black that together make for shimmery elegancenot at all the heather grey in the photo im b and the xs regular fits perfectand actually more slimmingfit than in the photo sleeves are longwhich i love a keeper especially on sale
i didnt think from the photo online that the sweater would be quite so sparkly gold it has gold weaved in so if the sparkly isnt your thing beware the sweater fit well although i didnt feel the neckline was quite as clean as in the photo above also youd have to be careful not to snag on jewelry its a thin sweater material that may require a camisole underneath depending on the weather
i tried this on in store yesterday and didnt buy it due to the dolman style sleeves and the scratchy lace dolman sleeves look terrible on me so this was a no go beware the scratchy lacei had this on for about minutes and was itching otherwise this will wok for plenty of people the color can be a nice neutral it does run large i usually wear a large and sized down to a medium it didnt work for me but im sure some will find it a nice part of their wardrobe
i couldnt tell on line this top has gold metallic thread running throughout i find metallic thread to be itchy when i first put it on i thought it might be ok i can tolerate a fair amount of itch in fabric after about minutes i suddently couldnt wait to get it off seemed like the longer it was next to my skin the more irritating it became it is also a bit thinner fabric than i expected i was hoping to use it as a layering piece it would work well for layering if it was comfortable
i actually like my shirt more than the other reviewers it seems i am little and and i dont think its too boxy at all i like the way it hangs and ill say i like it much more in person than on the model its somehow cozier than it looks in the picture its a real boosh that means comfy i wouldnt have picked it from the online pic but in person it really caught my eye
when i walked into my local retailer two of the saleswomen were wearing this stunning top in totally different ways and i knew it would be the perfect gift for my mom unfortunately the small was sold out but they were able to order it online and have it sent gorgeous mediumtolightweight fabric that looks great out or tucked in
i purchased this in the store i thought it was cute and unique i like most things with a raw edge i am lbs and purchased an xs i have worn it a couple of times and have received several compliments my only complaint is that when i saw the pic online i was annoyed the top is much wider than the photo depicts lying flat it measures side to side at the hem and from shoulder to hem why take photos that misrepresent the item there will only be more returns so if you li
this top is super soft cotton with raw edges on the sleeves and hem i bought the green top which is a medium faded olive color despite the picture this top is shortish in the front and on the sides which are slit the top is also very very boxy its wide across and doesnt fit the body at all the sleeves are a slimmer fit which contrasts nicely with the wide body the picture is very deceptive that said this top is perfect for early fall late summer super comfy floaty i wear
i am normally a small or xs with retailer clothing i saw the previous review that this dress runs small but the medium was sold out i am heartbroken i have to return and cant get my size since they are all gone was aiming to wear this to a high school reunion
i fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and got it as soon as it went on sale off the colors are vibrant and the fit is perfect whether you have areas that you want to hide or not it is true to size and i can see how you would want to size it down since its baby doll shape but it didnt work for me around the arm holes and mine are not that big i am and lb and size worked perfect
pretty color love the lace my husband thought it looked a little old ladyish but i think it depends on what you wear it with its been too hot here to wear yet i believe it will look great with a cami and leggings
the color is perfect for fall dressy enough for work and looks great with a pair of jeans
i purchased the green online in my usual medium i do like it but i will be returning it for a few reasons first i couldnt justify the price as its really not unique enough it kind of reminds me of a pajama top also i thought it was sleeve which it is not its long sleeve and lastly it appears to be regular length on the model im maybe at best and its shorter and boxy i gave it stars because i really like it for what it is but just not what i expected it is cute spor
i love every other byron lars dress ive bought and this was a no brainer for me when it arrived i was really disappointed the fabric is very stretchy which makes it super forgiving and very thick with all the buttons planted on this dress i was expecting it to open easily from the front as one of my other dresses by his does nope only the back buttons open thick stretchy fabric and back buttonsnot an easy thing to navigate i was also very sad to see that the length was all wrong for m
i always wear a small in retailer tops and this was very tight in the chest had to return for a medium cute top otherwise
im between a s m on most swing tops usually s which i thought id be in this one but not the case a m fit but i thought i could probably even wear a l which i never wear but it is gorgeous this is one of those shirts that keep me coming back to retailer this is a perfect fall top great tan color the beading is so so pretty and will really look great under sweaters this top looked so great with my louis vuitton bag it was just too good to pass up so go to your local store find th
great fitting and super cute my husband said this is the cutest bathing suit ive owned and i live in bathing suits
i love this design so much and it is very well made i also like the adjustable shoulder straps and that the cups are not padded cups i think that makes it look less like a bra and more like a bathing suit only con is that it seems to run small
a beautiful classic love the denim fabric in such a pretty style this top has a more flattering fit than appears in the pics the fabric is soft and the fit very flattering ordered my usual size medium and fits perfectlyvery true to size
i ordered this online with a little hesitation due to the negative reviews it arrived and it is beautiful the beading and subtle cut outs are gorgeous the colors of the beadwork in contrast to the nude tone of the fabric is stunning and elegant the fit is very very flattering runs very true to size
really cute topespecially the back ive tried on several of these tops that overlap in the back and none of them lay as nice as this one the soft cotton fabric really works well with this style runs tts and i love that the arms are more fitted with some stretch to the fabric regular length works fine on my petite frame as well the color is a darker cream and almost has a slight nubby effect to it first one i received had a snaghole in the lower sleeve so hopefully it holds up
this is a tts basic tee with the added flare of the ruffled back peplum and the elegance of the beaded front neckline the beading is lovely and mine was intact i bought my normal small based on reviews and the fit was perfect b the beige color is a classic neutral and can be worn year round by just adding a jacket or sweater love it
bought in the store will look great with black or dark blue jeans and a fun long necklace does not fit like it looks on the model it is more fitted i plan on wearing a spaghetti strapped cami underneath because the back has a draping effect and is open the front is on the shorter side but the bottom of the shirt not including tassels reaches the top of my jeans and the tassels hang below it is a very versatile top one that can be dressed up or down sleeves above wrist
very pretty top the fabric is super soft i ended up sizing up from my regular xs to a s because the chest area was just a bit snug
love these lightweight pants theyre beyond comfortable and the print is darling hope this designer has additional pieces next season
i adore this shirt like a previous reviewer the shirt runs a little small in the bust i got a instead of my typical and it looks great the quality is great and the color is lovely the feel of the fabric is nice substantial weight
the design is gorgeous and the fabric feels great not a lot of functionality then again i did buy the kimono to feel sexy and not to keep warm i ordered the xsmallsmall and feel i should have ordered the medlarge unless youre super tinyfit id recommend sizing up here i bet it would still be super flattering a touch larger
this is adorable the sweater is lightweight and soft please know that the sweater line falls right at my midriff followed by the fringe so for me its almost cropped the fringe covers my midriff the back is open and so this sweater will not be super warm in the winter but it is stylish and cute i love it its different and unique i purchased xxs in petite fits a little more cropped than the photo shows
these leggings are so thick and soft they feel like velvet on your skin i am so so happy with my purchase and would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a unique comfortable and quality pair of leggings
this button down is to die for the material is incredibly soft and comfy it looks great with my retailer leggings and is also a great look with my casual denim paired with a cardi and flats or booties ive worn it several times for different looks and always get compliments on it definitely a headturning piece
this sweater looks just as pictured on the model its very warm though even with cropped sleeves i ordered a large and it was true to size but roomy i liked this top very much but is thicker than seems outer grey material isnt very pleasant itchy however the bottom portion is an underneath gown and attached to sleeves inside so its very soft on touch
this has a very nice hang to it combination of the cut and linen like fabric i liked it so much that i bought two different colors so many tees are blousy and full nowi am short so they look like maternity tops this one is much more flattering
fantastic top fits flatters and falls beautifully i loved the white so much i went back for the black i wear with jeans leggings and with pant suits lovely with all
this coat is so stylish and actually reminded my daughter of the madeline stories she just got her first paid internship in the city so i am buying this beautiful red coat for her to celebrate after all a girl has to make a good first impression
ordered this coat in a small it is meant to be a slouchy and the fit is perfect im and weigh around the sleeves are slightly longer than the fabric is so soft the coat is unlined and drapes beautifully this coat reminds me of a coat my mother had when i was a child she referred to it as her car coat i believe that was a style then worth the 
i bought the white and olive today i usually get a size s but opted for the xs for this shirt i am longer torsoed than perhaps average so it came to just below midbutt which i like my shoulders are on the broader side and a bit muscular but even still the xs was perfect and cute rather than just comfy def an undershirt is needed for these but i run cold so i nearly always have an undershirt the fabric is just nice enough that i could wear the shirt with a fun nice skirt with a high
love this top i have it in several colors and im waiting for the black to be restocked its somewhat sheer perfect w my kimonos
i bought this tee for a light summer top as i love linen this top does not disappoint i bought my usual size xs and the length is goodslightly longer in back i purchased the black and the grey the grey will be great with jeans in any color and the black i can wear either dressed up or down the quality seems good great purchase
i adore this top i ordered in the white and wear it with everything i am a c and size and purchased the xs it was slightly snug in the arms but it does stretch i just bought the black as well as it truly it a great staple piece forewarning do not dry this my husband accidentally did and i was forced to buy another one since it shrunk so much the fabric is lightweight and great for summer but keep in mind that it is thin and may require something underneath tank top etc
this dress was so comfortable i wore it all day to church out to brunch and actually slept in it it would travel well too
i bought this tshirt in three colors and im keeping them because they work for what i want travel clothes but the tshirts run big and are too boxy i think they look nice if you tuck them in
i have not a actually purchased this coat yet but was able to try it on at my local retailer thought id pass along a couple of details the description is missing the coat is not lined i have regular length arms and the sleeves are a bit short not quite length but not long enough to keep my wrists warm also i was afraid the red would be more orange it is a very pretty red it also runs a little big i am medium athletic build and would probably consider a m but it seemed bi
i love this coat it is exactly what i was looking for it is unlined with cute fabric edging on the seams and a lightweight wool but it is roomy enough for layering and that is what i like about it also like the length as it can conceal a long tunic sweater without it hanging out the bottom it is very versatile in that it can be worn with something dressy or jeans and leggings also like that i can add any fun scarf to dress it up or down its a great contemporary shape i would say this c
i echo what the other reviews say this is a tshirt but its very flattering i bought the black and dressed it with a bright turquoise necklace and received a ton of compliments extremely comfortable ive been just looking for this shirt when i get home from work or having to do errands because it is that comfortable im buying more its so comfortable and flattering
love this cost runs large usually wear a medium or large ordered a medium and had to exchange it for a small fits perfect now not very heavy so dont buy if youre looking for a warm coat
i love the way this coat looks in the website it turned out to be a little different than i thought it would be cant decide if i will keep it the sleeves are bracelet length i have long arms so slightly awkward for me i ordered the small even though i wear a medium in everything else so glad i did because it is biggish on me it is unlined but made of a lovely soft wool the edges are all finished with a bias edging which is unique and well done it is boxy very lovely wo
i love everything about this skirt the fabric is super comfy and it drapes wonderfully fits great a bit long for me as im but totally worth it i dont wear heels so i might need to alter the length but i knew it would be long when i ordered it i purchased the grey but i might have to order the taupe as well
i bought an extra small and i love it im a size its warm its comfortable it fits with everything can be dressed up or down its not lined but it is well finished and does not feels like a sweater coatit feels like you have a new friend
loved this sweater when i saw it online when it arrived it had a very strong chemical smell to it and was very stiff textured despite the dry clean only tag i decided to soak it overnight in woolite to soften it and get rid of the smell the next day i rinsed it in cold water and block dried it outside it still wreaked of chemicals and took three more subsequent washings to finally get rid of the smell hand washing did not hurt it whatsoever fyi it looks fab with jeans and is very comfy i
i love this coat it was a great purchase and i would reccomend it to others it looks great with layers and is comfortable for degree temps definitely size down when buying
this top is light and swingy with a bold pattern that looks even better in person the neckline is very high which was a surprise for a summer tank but its cut well nice surprise on seem pockets wore it today for the first time and received many comments a keeper fits true to size and perfect for my petite build up top
this is a great little top colors are beautiful and more vibrant in real life ordered size large and the fit is the same as the model you could probably size down armholes are a bit large but am picky about that area and i can work with it the body flows but its not huge and is slimming the high neck and tie are darling will be cute under a sweater or jacket as weather cools good buy on sale
runs small in the chest so dont order if you are large chested over all very cute
i love this jumpsuit its fun flirty and seems to put a smile on the faces of passersby it works for multiple occasionsevents and is so comfortable if daytime pajamas sounds good to you this is your jumpsuit dress it up with an updo and dangly earrings or down with slipons and a cardigan i have found that i cant go wrong with it fits me just perfectly doesnt wrinkle too much during wear and the adjustable shoulder ties are convenient
i love the serif jeans and these stet midrise jeans fit perfectly too true to size and i really like the wash i am and a size and the fits just right because of my height they come closer to the ankle on me than what you see on the model i have more of an athletic build rather than curvy
flattering fit true to size i ordered which fit perfectly i am lbs wish it came in off whitesand and black great with boots and more substantial than some leggings also extremely comfy
these look great on my wife very versatile and go with like of her wardrobe she raves about them and they look great
love this shawlwrap was looking to purchase the white warren cashmere poncho but available online only and then saw this in the store tried it on and fell in love love that its cashmere super soft and warm would recommend
very flattering ang comfy but they do run slightly big i stayed with my true size because i am thicker in waist but if small waisted size down fit tys in legs and bottom love color
great fit and extremely comfortable
this dress is so beautifully embroidered with really cool mix of colors it is pricey but i do think it will stand the test of time and become an retailer vintage piece planning to wear it now with wedges and in the fall with booties and a light sweater
i love these jeans i wear them all the time i love the way they fit and the price is great please make these exact pants in more colors
i got the cream color and absolutely love the style and color of this sweater however when i tried it on at the store the one i tried on was super soft and comfy i ended up finding this later on sale and ordered it online when i got it i dont know if it was once worn or washed by someone before but the inside was not soft at all i was so sad anyone else have this experience size is great i ordered an xs
i saw this in stores and ran right up to it because of the gorgeous embroidery work and vivid colors unfortunately those bright colors are totally washed out in the online model picsbarely recognizable the fabric itself is super soft and not at all stiff plus it has pockets i can see this looking great with leggings and boots but the sleeves flared a little too much which i think would add bulk under a cardigan so it might not carry as far into cooler months as i would like my usual s
i love the details that this cardigan has try it
i tried it one bcasue it is on sale and i love ittoo bad i dont need yet anothr black top fit is looseflowy but the ruffles add a littl cahrm to the shirt tried on regualr xs i could proably go to petites though but thankfully there is a button at the neck
i tried this sweater on instore in grey from front it appears like a nice normal sweater even a little boring but the side and back are wow really fun the colors and swing of the back material look great especially with jeans the front is short making you wonder if its supposed to be a crop top also the style of the sweater lets isnt very warm because the back is so loose and flowy i couldnt decide whether to buy it or not maybe i will wait for a sale
i ordered this for the colors and modern geometric design colors are as shown a beautiful combination that works well with blue jeans and my burgundy flats its casual and soft enough to wear all day i wore it to the beach then out to dinner the same evening oh i spilled red wine on it at the beach and couldnt wash it until the next day i used dawn dish detergent and hydrogen peroxide on the spots then laundered in the washer on hot and they came out completely i air dried and
very cute print love the mix of the colors on this sweater looks great with jeans throw it on over a tshirt and you are set
i normally wear a size but i have a pair of shorts by same designer bought several years ago in a size and so i went with a size for this purchase they fit perfectly i would have liked to order the petite but it did not appear to be an option the fabric is very soft and stretchy they are little loose around the ankle but i have very skinny calves and ankles so that is not so surprising the color is a perfect grey that will go with everything i would buy these in other colors
this dress is rayon not silk like the description says that doesnt bother me that much because its a really cute dress its also hand washable which i like i hate going to the dry cleaners it fits true to size and i know i will wear it for lots of occasions from casual to business i almost always wear a small in retailer dresses and this one is the same im and the length hits me at the knee so it might be too short for taller girls the only other thing that was unexpected
pretty and with pockets also nice quality for the price interesting texture
i absolutely love these pants they are my new favorite thank you 
i am very happy with this ponchosweater it is my first cashmere sweater and it feels so soft and luxurious true it does not have full length sleeves but if you adjust the sweater so that it comes down lower on your shoulders it will come well past your elbows covering most of your arms i feel very elegant wearing it looks great with skinny pants or leggings and boots would recommend
love this sweater so much i purchased the grey and the pink so far no issues with the stitching
i ordered the large but it swallowed me the store happened to have a medium so i was able to make an exchange the medium fit perfect im delighted to include this in my wardrobe
i love these jeans perfect amount of stretch without sag great color ordered my usual size i wish they had these in olive and black
these are a lovely neutral to slightly warm grey pair of jeans from a great line i wore my usual size without issues
let me start by saying this skirt is beautiful quality it is a stretchy material which makes it very comfy i ordered a large because i am a size sometimes in jeans but i get the waist taken in on almost every pair of jeans i have ever owned my tailor calls me kim k lol i was hoping i wouldnt have that same problem with this skirt but the waist is enormous but fits my hips thighs and booty like a dream im hoping a tailor can have the waist taken in if i didnt have a small
these are probably my th pair of pilcro legging jeans and though i love the color sort of a worn in soft black dark gray these particular pair fit a tiny bit more snug than any of my others it could be the fact that these are ankle length vs most others are long with the cords being extra long and cozy so i wonder if the fact that these are shorter they tend to sit on my legs a little differently it may also be just this pair was cut a tiny bit smaller i am toying with the idea of ask
had to return for a larger size like the design though quality wasnt as expected but since i purchased on sale i decided not to return the top but exchange for a larger size which i hope is still available
i got this shirt in an xxsp and it has a great slim body the front ruffle isnt overpowering although i dont love the ruffles on the sleeves i think its just a little too much but they arent visible under a sweater or jacket the length is just right so the shirt can be tucked in or left untucked without looking long and messy the silk is just a touch sheer but not too seethrough its a good shirt
i on the other hand wore these once and boy did they stretch during the day i really hope they shrink back up
i bought the green pair in store and loved their fit i ended up buying the rust color online too im and i went down a size to a cause they will stretch a little perfect length for my height too great with wedges or boots
i bought this dress after i had overnighted a different one and it wasnt going to be delivered on time im so happy that i bought this dress its so comfortable and easy to wear i got lots of compliments on it it runs very large though i ended up with a size i initially tried on the as i have a larger chest the still had plenty of room
it feels weightless and is so feminine great for layering or on its own so happy i purchased it know i will get tons of use out of it
these jeans are great the rise is perfect
this sweatshirt is a very nice staple piece i think it can be easily dressed up and down the quality is quite nice and should hold up over time the sizing of this really depends on the desired fit i elected to go with a size small because i felt that it fit a little bit closer to my figure and the length seemed to go better with skirts but honestly i tried the medium as well and it was much different just a bit more slouchy and looser in the arms if layering is desired for reference
everything that pilcro makes for pants fit me great i am not skinny but these pants fit me in a way that you cant see my belly i love when pilcro goes on sale because they are a great quality and getting their stuff on sale is a bonus
i bought these about a month ago and i love them great fit not too tight for legging jeans which means i can dress up with a tunic and boots for work so stretchy and comfortable but still made out of a jeantype material love the color its a bit of a gray black so looks great with everything
im and and the fit comfortably i initially bought the but felt it was snug in the seat so switched out for the im so didnt want the painted on look they will need to be washed more frequently since they do stretch out as they are worn love the gray color and goes with so many fall colors
i love almost everything about this first you know its cashmere soft soft soft without being heavy im a little afraid to wear it its so nice i got the gray which is a beautiful light casual shade of gray that looks great with everything the pockets are fantastic if a bit useless they hang lower than i can reach with my hands the construction is a bit odd at first it took me some browfurrowing to figure out how to put it on and i dont love the way the two front panels hang
obsessed with these pants i have them in the green color and was looking for them to go on sale great fit very comfortable
these are colors i normally never wearbaby pink lavender light bluebut what drew me to this was the wine color mixed in its my favorite i also adore a good poncho this poncho is so rich and so heavenly super soft very oversized incredibly nice fabricits like a light weight sweater lots of movement and such a statement piece it will look great over a white tank top or an all black ensemble with great boots this only comes in two sizes but runs large im and curvyand
bought the green in the store wore them every week for weeks so i bought the bronze color too i usually wear a in pilcro because they do give a little during the day i had to go up to the because the thighs were a little too snug for me theres a zipper at the ankle so getting you foot through isnt a problem the fabric is sturdy it almost feels like a brushed cotton soft to the touch they zip up the side so are very slimming im for reference
i am curvypetite this fits great is true to size is super comfortable and lined with cotton very pretty and well made
this dress is beautiful i usually wear a or and i ordered a it is huge i will be returning
this has a heftier fabric than seems to be in the picture online i wish it were the same fabric as the fringed chambray dress that coupled with it being cut very generously and the hip placement of the bulky pocket fabric causes it to look quite thick and dumpy unless you pin your elbows in to show where your waist is i usually wear a and bought the im returning it for a petite and see how that goes i love it so im hoping that causes the fit to appear more as it does on the
lightweight silk with sweet details ruffles fits comfortably and nice for workplace with suit or more casual
i saw this t on sale and ordered it i had second thoughts thinking it would be just like a lot of ts i already have well i got it today and am thrilled the fabric is so soft a sumptuous softness that makes me feel good the fit is the fit we all want in a great t nice fit not too baggy not too tight and it is so flattering it doesnt show off my tummy as so many other ts do i can wear this with jeans or a skirt so glad i got it
this dress is gorgeous in person soft and wonderfully comfortable with two large pockets it also comes with a cotton knit slip for added swing i bought at size which was two sizes smaller than my normal size in retailer dresses i have worn twice and each time random strangers have complimented it it dry cleaned beautifully and it is really fun to wear the model is shows the neck wide open but it is very cute tied in a little bow expensive maybe but well worth it
this dress definitely runs large so i ordered it through my local store in order to get a size that would fit i ordered one size down but could have gone down i love the embroidered design i just wore the dress to a slovak festival yesterday and it fit right in very comfortable and fun to wear
best jeggings ever they look and fit like skinny jeans but feel like leggings soft but substantial fabric nice dark gray worn in color
lets discuss the neckline its fabulous furthermore this sweater can go anywhere its dress up dress down feeling low this girl will lift you up and take you to town
love the length color and rise new favorite jeans theyre a little loose around the ankle and the way they hang is the only thing i dont like
great leggings theyre well made and comfortable to wear my only complaint is that they seem to be stretching just a little and dont fit perfectly
i absolutely love the fit and look of these jeans i am and they fit perfectly but oh mythe smell its like burnt chemicals i dont know if its just this pair or a problem with this dye in general any one find any solution to this doesnt seem to go away with washing may have to return these jeans if i cant get rid of the smell 
i love this summery blouse it sits at high hip so no tucking in the sleeves are fluttery and flattering to the arm i own this same pattern in a knit and like it so much i got the woven when i saw it the only downsides are that it has to be ironed and it the sleeves are too big to layer under a sweater
i ordered these jeans to wear to work since they are very dark and tailored my usual size fit perfectly but they did have to go to the tailors since they were incredibly long which is nice for those of you that need more lengthgiven that i usually am in skinnies i like how they fit singly on the hips and slightly flare out towards the bottom but not too much these will work well with a variety of looks making the price tag well worth it
just love this sweater have it in both colors can be dressed up or more casual
this dress is really beautiful in person it comes with a spaghetti strap clingy cotton slip underneath it runs at least sizes large i tried my usual size and needed to go down to a zero
i just got this in and i love it its happy super soft and will be perfect for the fall season in new orleans since its not too light but also not heavy i see myself wearing this often
just like in picture super cute and comfortable sweater
i am all about beach cover ups i already have the leblon one from this season which i loooooove but i love this one tooand it is in my goto color which is fantastic i love beach cover ups i always imagine the sounds of the birds waves rolling in and a nice breeze allowing it to flow as i walk along side the beach my reality of course is chasing after screaming kids and walking along a mn pond not rolling waves but this dress would at least make me feel like i am in my own little wo
love the pockets and back of dress the buttons on the the straps allow for them to be adjusted thats a plus im with an athletic build at d the medium fits perfect
this is a beautiful casual topit is a loose fit that is generously sized so instead of my usual large i purchased the medium for a better fitthe length is perfect not too long or short the colors coordinate great with denim
when i saw these in the store i liked how they were different from usual leggings and the nice fabric weight i especially liked how they were not tight at the ankle and fit similar to a pair of ankle pants since i wanted a slightly looser fit i usually wear a i went w a medium cant wait for the weather to get colder so i can wear them with a sweater and ankle boots
i look at the top quite a few times before i bought it i absolutely love it its a super soft thick cotton material it drapes perfectly and wears well
stunning bought it today and i love it it runs big im usually a xss and went with the xs and its perfect flowy and comfy im lbs great for summer and i think will transition great into fall with a cardigan
really like the quality color and overall design of these jeans they ran a little long on me but i just cut off an inch from the bottom and they fit perfectly with some tall booties i didnt need to get them altered because the design of them is that they are cut at the bottom and are a little frayed so glad that was the case given the price tag on them i am lbs and wear a size which fit perfectly except for the length which was easily fixed definitely recommend these jeans
i bought this tank to go with the navy wide legs pants shown in the picture i bought this top in a and could have gone a size down im very small chested i think that for someone with a larger chest it is probably more true to size i wanted the extra length so im keeping the im ft lbs and usually wear a medium or large in retailer tops the layering of the top is very pretty as is the embroidery
this top is adorable normally wear small or xs but got xxs based on reviews and glad i did still really loose but so cute would have preferred petite but sold out
i knew i had to have this as soon as i saw it pop up in the tops section its effortless love the quirky design and the overall fit its a tad on the large side but im all about the flow these days oh and the poms at the bottom about sent me over the edge fantastic piece
very comfortable great quality with beautiful crocheted front top and lovely blend of colors
great top can be dressed up or down the lace is great quality and i love the border detailing i found this shirt to run pretty true to size
this henley has a lot of very nice details lace embroidery the material is soft and a little bit sheer more so in the lacey sections it is made in india and the style strikes me as a bit indian looking the only thing i do not like is that there are two buttons along the v shape decolltagebut there are no button holes on the other side so they are purely for decoration you can see those buttons in the enlarged detail view only this irks me a bit because i would like to button the sh
i love the unique design the details are wonderful it runs a bit large but it works a great piece
these pants are amazing material on the thickerheavier side the pants are very comfortable and very cute for the fall fits perfect
love the unique stitching on the shirt and the dye job i think it does run a little big the arm holes are quite deep even in a medium but the fabric is thin so a tank underneath would probably work out well
i like this top it is a nice casual top i think it looks better on the model because it looks a bit dressy when i tried it on it looked good but not as dressy the embroidery on the side gives the top a nice look i also like the tiedye look the price is high i got it on sale price the fabric is a simple tshirt the embroidery makes it stand out i am keeping it
love i always used to wear skinny jeans until i discovered these highly recommend they elongate your legs and curve in just the right places super flattering plus they are extremely comfortable however im ft inches and i have to wear a good inch heel with them
i ordered this shirt in the greyblue color choice the creamy grey is perfectly heathered and the blue silklike bottom is a classy touch the fit of this shirt in the arms torso and back was flattering with a little room to drape love it
this hoodie is really cutei got the polka dot color and it is very soft and roomy i am normally a small but got the medium and it fits exactly how i wanted howeverit is not a pullover and instead zips up so odd that the pic of the hoodie is a pullover debated returning because i wanted a pullover but have decided to keep it because of how soft it is
i love this peasant dress i have worn it twice already with black lizard cowboy bootsfrye jane boots black tights and silver sparkly earrings no need for a necklace because of the beautiful beading at the yoke the fabric is rayon and has a beautiful drape so it doesnt poof out like a maternity dress it is lined has sleeves with an elasticized cuff and hits around my knee this dress could have definitely supported pockets in the side seams or patch pockets on the front i have
i bought this today in black it fits true to size and is very flattering i love the draping the weight of the fabric and the length i would buy it in another color i like it so much i will probably wear this with jeans and boots with a sweater over it i wasnt sure i was going to like the little connector piece across the front neckline but it works if it wasnt there the top would probably gape open
i saw this dress online this morning went into a store this afternoon and walked out with it i love this brand because the designs are modest but feminine and practical this dress is made of a thicker study cotton with beautiful all over embroidery the fit is tts and you can adjust the waist to fit loose or a bit more snug the length is just above my knee at i plan to wear this now with black boots and a furry vest and later by itself with sandals and big sunnies
i bought this in the neutral motif and its exactly as it appears online except a bit more vivid in real life the colors are ivory with dusty pink and bluegray puffs of color the fabric is incredibly soft i usually wear a small in tops but went up to a medium and im glad i did if you like things really fitted i guess you could order your normal size but since i wanted this to have some room for long sleeves underneath i went with the medium this ziphoodie is great quality and it look
i tried this dress at the store today and couldnt leave without it also tried the pacquerette shirtdress which has a similar bohopeasant vibe and overall preferred the fit and look of this one plus its lined which the paquerette shirtdress is not for the same price fit was very similar to the anwen peasant dress which i also have and the regular size xs fit me much the same as in that dress it is maybe inch longer though but still that makes it a couple of inches above the knee for
i love this dress i typically do not like or wear dresses often and definitely not this style im glad i tried something different i received numerous compliments on how flattering and attractive it is yes the belt is only in the front but i cinched it very tight and it pulled the back in i bought size s it was very form fitting in the top and waist and not too big through the hips i have a bust and i can button all the top without pulling i wore it with black tights and high brow
i saw this in the store and it caught my eye right away due to its bold color and pattern i tried on an extra small and it was large especially in the sleeves i ordered an extra small in petite and it fits perfectly i love the velvet and jeweled detail along with the cris cross tie i wore it to work today and received so many compliments one lady said how artsy i looked i paired it with burgundy velvet tie up boots to complete the look totally worth the money ladies
i wore this dress on thanksgiving with black tights and black flats and it looked great the dress is forgiving if youre trying to hide a chunky waistline because the belt doesnt go all the way around its just in the front so it gives the illusion of a waistline and doesnt look like just a sack if you have a great waistline you may not like this i wish it were a bit longer but with black tights it looked fine im no where near as tall as the model and it was about above my
i tried this on xs and thought it would be great butit was simply bog on me and boxy unfortunately they are out of petite in the grey color my favorite of the this top is soft and feminine if it fits properly but too big was a little too boxy
the dress is nice love the embroidery love the front cinch but why not all the way around the back is fast flat so cinching makes the sides stick outgot petite and the sizing was nice i just didnt love the overall look on my body type
this is a lovely top sooo soft very flattering draping if you have a bit of a tummy i wasnt sure about it on the hanger but was pleasantly surprised when i tried it on very glad i have it a chance
this dress is a marvel its flattering and cute it is great for work a date or just a casual day and machine washable best thing ive ever purchased from retailer
i love this dress i would have never picked it off the hanger in the store in fact i went right past it however when i was in the dressing room trying something else on i saw two girls wearing it and it was adorable i immediately tried it on and loved it i think it runs really big i am normally a size athletic build and i bought the xsmall i small also fit but was a bit too baggy most topsdresses at retailer also run big so it makes sense this does too but there is no way i am a true
cute and different dress cute with bootsvery comfortable runs large could size down
surprised that this is a fallwinter dress the embroidery is beautiful but the material isnt that thick and the tie at the waist is unusual would have been better if rather than having the tie built into the dress it was separate
its exactly how it appears in the picturesawesome shirt
i bought this shirt in the turquoise color with the navy trim and love it color is as pictured shirt is very soft and flowy the length was a little shorter than expected the slits on the side almost reach the top of my jeans so im glad i got the regular xs and not the petite this shirt is unique without getting too crazy
lovely at a the size small was a great fit moss color is really quite grey drapes beautifully and is an easy wear
this top is soft flattering modest enough to wear to work but subtly sexy and im amply endowed at d i just wish id gotten one in every color
i tried this on at the store and am coming online to order it in petite im and the length hit me just below the knee in the regular length so im hoping it will hit just above the knee in petite it was very cute might run a bit large but basically true to size size down if between sizes it has a little bit of sparkle beading around the neck which is nice
this black dress with raised white embroidery is lovely and flattering the fabric has a nice texture and is mediumweight cotton and machine washable the dress is unlined its a bit hard to get on and take off even though the buttons can be undone which helps there is a tie at the waist drawstringstyle i only wish my store had the petite size as i am wondering whether the xs that fit me in the store will still fit as an xs p
got this today and highly recommend it it fits perfectly and is very flattering i can see wearing this all wear round perfect date shirt
i saw this dress online and blined it to the store to try on it is a beautifully made dress lots of great detail with stitching and beading on the front placket feels very boho and chic i have received lots of compliments while wearing this dress i was almost turned off by the price but decided to see it in person worth every penny wear it with sandals or tall boots could have worn a medium but a little tight for c on top
so this shirt is very cute i like the drape if you can get it arranged properly but it is not black more of a charcoal bordering on heathered navy i wear all black so it quite obviously stands out as a different color in my closet i am keeping it thinking i will wear it with leather since it is flattering and the keyhole is something different i am a true medium and bought the medium and it fits fine a little shorter in the back but not a deal breaker
i love everything about this top first its super flattering especially if you have a tummy i am small chested and it makes me look a little chestier than i am i tried on both the xs and s in the black its really a charcoal gray but preferred the fit of the xs note im lbs and typically wear an xs or s in most retailer tops the small seemed too drapey and the armholes were a tad big my store didnt have the wine color or i would have purchased it too
i think this shawl is much more stunning on than on the hanger i think it will be a great piece to transition into fall wearing it over a black or white tee it can be dressed up or down especially for the sale price a great piece
this arrived today and i am thrilled with it the material is soft but not at all clingy it drapes perfectly falling just above the knee there is a matching slip that is as nicely made as the dress itself what a find
love this dress the neckline is gorgeous
very cool top i purchased this in the black which is more of a very dark gray imagine sanded silk its very figure flattering and accentuates curves it also disguises any minor tummy issues not to clingy but follows your form the fabric is well made with a perfect drape to match the style definitely a winner
colors are vibrant i ordered the blue color combo material is light and feels great against your skin
this dress is absolutely gorgeous the colors are actually very bright it has a little embroidery and beading in the chest area the fabric is actually very soft and it comes with built in slip i found that it runs true to size i got a medium as i wanted it to be more roomy im planning to wear it with booties long boots or sandals in the spring i think it will make a great teacher dress
very figure flattering i am lbs b chest and size xs is perfect
these are nice flattering bra with light to medium suport however the colors and patters are not quite as pictured i almost suspect they are slightly different on each bra exmaple on the picture online the left side seems to be a light blue and the right one orange on the bra i received the left side is a darker bluishgreen color the right side is orange and light purple i would hae prefered the colors on the photo but it is not a big deal i guess i ordered the color block shorts as we
i purchased this online because i just loved the gorgeous designs and embroidery it has a unique cut to it as it has wrist holes but is otherwise open i have a difficult time keeping it from falling off of my shoulders when i wear it over bear skin i hope it will stay in place when i wear it over long sleeves or a sweater overall i am happy with it but i think it may run small as it hits the model at her wrists but hits me above my elbow i am not very tall or longlimned so it seems strang
i cannot believe how different this top looks in person i purchased this in the store and fell in love with it immediately viewing the pictures on here does not do the top justice it is very form fitting and compliments large busted women the cut is not too low and lays beautifully
i had my eye on this tee for awhile and finally ordered the turquoisenavy in the small as soon as i received it i ordered it in the taupepeach and am contemplating one more i plan to layer it now and cant wait to wear it solo next spring and summer the colors are gorgeous although the taupe is more dark gray which i love the material is very soft stretchy and comfortable but its the very flattering cut that sold me it hangs beautifully and doesnt cling to my middle but skims it p
i am generally a size l and after reading reviews sized down the inner layer was a little snug but this was not an issue because of the outer layer great dress
this dress is a winner im baffled that there is only one review i thought this was a dolan dress the material is soft and substantial the cut and style hides figure flaws without adding bulk this versatile dress is perfect for all seasons and all social situations im and purchased size m
i just bought this and really think it is a great dress it is conservative and i will be able to wear it to teach or play the organ at my church i am a church organist and college professor and need conservative clothes yet i do not like to look frumpy this is cute and chic yet conservative also j got because it is black friday thank you retailer
great dress fits tts i am a p and purchased a sp looks good with boots or ballet flats
perfection soft lived in feel and look without holes or rips and for someone who is ft in they are just the right length if i dont feel like cuffing the bottom fit tts
as other reviews noted this runs largehuge is more like it its great quality but im wondering now if the sm would take me through the third trimester of pregnancy which is why i ordered a ml im and if i were any less i dont think this would work for me at all
nice basic shirt to wear with jeans it is super soft and hangs nicely runs true to size
i ordered this in a small and it fit perfectly i love the longer length so that it can be worn with leggings the detail is so pretty especially the colorful side panels
i bought these leggings for yoga i love them the material is so soft and also seems sweat wicking which is a plus the back detail on the calf is a nice touch of flair compared to basic leggings the waistband is wide and did not fold over during practice for reference i am lbs and i purchased a m fit was great i normally wear size in pants would recommend
this seems like a great top i have only worn it once but it is super soft and comfy yet stylish sleeves are fun color is vibrant as shown
i purchased this shirt to wear postpartum so i could easily be comfortable but still cute it will work well for the fall with some cute jeans and booties i cannot wait to wear itany day now great choice
it is a beautiful shirt and fits perfectly i purchased it in ivory and although not a true ivory it has some pinkish tones to it it is absolutely beautiful looks perfect with a long necklace and jeans
this top runs large for sure and reminds me more of a tunic due to the length nice detailing around neck and sleeves and the paisley print on the side hems is super cute size down
soft material lays nicely got an xs but usually wear a smaill got it in the mail and it is wrinkly so will need to steam it
regarding the product high quality materials and overall make extremely comfortable and flattering cut id love this in all the colors of the rainbow
this is a beautiful top the fit is very flattering im tall with broad shoulders and the sleeves hit just above my elbow i wear it on the weekends and to workvery versatile i washed it in the washing machine and hung to dry its the same size and no fadingnot sure about the others below with shrinkage issues highly recommend it
this top is extremely well made the fabric is so soft the style is very stylish it is very figure flattering and chic a keeper im petite and the style is not overwhelming
this top flows so nice i get so many compliments when i wear it plus the color is an interesting blue
so glad i finally bought this love it and have received many compliments wore it with brown over the knee boots one of my fave all time outfits right now
very good quality love the length of it i wore it with a belt since on me without it looked a bit too big i bought the blue one
i was on the fence about this dress but so glad i did thanks to the reviews i sized down from my normal medium to a small and this dress is definitely one of my favs it is a quality comfortable material that does stretch and allows you movement with ease the illusion slims me in the middle where i need it most i adore this dress
i almost missed this i snagged it during the black friday sale online i got an extra small and it fits greatnot too fitted the back is a cotton material with some stretch to it the embroidery is beautiful
i ordered this dress in both colors im very fair and blonde and the darker dress just swallowed me up looked really messy on me the lighter onelove it its very flowy and not form fitting of course but something about the lighter color just seems less overwhelming
i like this dress a lot it does not have much form but with a belt looks great
i bought both color options in this dress and they are both gorgeous but i think this dress must only look good on the model and her body types because i put it on and cringed im and slim it was matronly i also ordered my usual size small and felt like the medium might have been better the picture of blue colored dress looks more fitted around the waist and these dresses and very loose the only way it would be flattering is if you added a belt keep that in mind if you do buy pretty
love this dress the stripes are flattering the material is interesting and it swings its feminine and fun
i ordered the peachivorytan version in size xl and i love everything about this dress im size xl and a pearshape so dresses can be hit or miss this one is a favorite its so soft the mix of colors and the sizing of the stripespleats is flattering its nice being more fitted on top flowy through the bottom i love this dress so much im having fun pairing different combos of necklaces vests pins belts boots with it ill get good use out of this through spring comfortable pret
i have been self conscious about a recent weight gain going from a size to a size but this dress makes me look feel skinny again i know people have suggested that vertical stripes help if you want to elongate your figure it is true thanks to this dress i look like my old self and i am super comfortable wearing this all the time you can wear this dress from day to night you can dress this up or down it looks great with a jean jacket and hightops or highheeled booties with a n
by itself this dress is a disaster its semimaternity and offers no shape at all however with a belt it really becomes the sweetest sweater dress i cant believe how flattering the dress becomes with a belt the skirt falls perfectly its perfect especially with its rich colors for you cant go wrong and im positive you need this dress boots heels jacket whatever it goes up and down its perfect
i have worn this beautiful sweater with all kinds of outfits i love to dress it down with ripped skinnies booties some long layered necklaces i did not have as big an aversion to the itch factor as the other reviewer but it is definitely not super soft or anything it fit a little larger than true to size in my opinion i shouldve ordered a small i think its a very unique winter staple that matches almost every single thing in my wardrobe its versatile snuggly warm id recommend
its a perfect maternity dress but i love that i will still be able to wear it with a belt once the baby comes
i walked into a hair salon wearing this dress and everyone who walked by complimented me to me thats a definite winner i got the blue color and the various colors in it are vibrant and lively the underdress is like a full slip and an added bonus this probably also makes the dress hang the way it should theres no static or clinging where there shouldnt be i was afraid i might be too short to pull this off but i absolutely love it
i saw this dress online first and suspected i would like it but the price scared me away then while visiting in portland i saw it on sale at an retailer store when i came out of the dressing room to look in a bigger mirror the store clerk said well thats a nobrainer i thought the same thing i love this dress so much i actually would have paid full price for it its super fun and easy to wear i paired it with navy blute tights and suede ankle booties im lbs and the m
i just got this at the black friday sale i may have passed it by had i not been in an adventurous mood i usually wear brighter colors it feels wonderfulcozy and silky like expensive pjs looks very glamorous yet laid back i feel like i am in a s romantic film i got a ps and it fits flowy it was the only one so i was not able to try the xs love it it was cold today so i wore a cami under it with lace peeking thru the low neckline 
this dress fits great and is very warm for the winter months
i just ordered this dress in blue on sale and it was such a bargain for the quality and look its a very comfortable dress that swings and flatters my body type which is tall and thin i think this dress would not work on a more busty womans frame but it definitely works for me im and pounds and a small is plenty big i often take a medium i definitely recommend this dress
i own many tiny tops and like other reviews have stated this is a favorite the ombre design makes it stand out the embroidery is beautiful these are usually tops i throw on during my time offweekends and i have received many compliments on this one tiny usually runs small but this is true to size or even a size smaller
i wasnt sure how clingy this dress might be or how it would look on my curvy body its actually really lovely it runs large but not overwhelming nice length above the knee in the front slightly longer in the back the colors are really beautiful i got the darker color will definitely wear this with a belt otherwise i think as other reviewers said it will be too maternitylooking i got this at a great sale price
i saw this online when it was full price and was tempted to buy it because i liked it but did not when i saw it on sale definitely wanted to try it i bought a large and it was too big in the torso area so i returned and got a medium and it fit better and flattered my figure better i so rarely wear a medium in anything retailer so i would say this runs large i have received compliments on this dress the first day i wore it it is comfortable love the colors and design it is fun very g
ilove this dress even though it does run big i put a belt with it and it looks stunning
saw this in the store and loved it the photos on line do not do this justice material is soft and substantial if you love the look of raw edge youll love this piece as usual i wish it were a bit shorter even in petites as i am only but kept it and love it
theres not much to add to what reviewers have said beautiful flowing lightweight fabric flattering cut gorgeous ombre tone with feminine embroidery a great shirt for hanging out of dressing up this is one of those shirts you expect from retailer you wouldnt find it anywhere else ive had this shirt a couple of months now and have to note that even with careful treatment some of the embroidery is coming loose its gotten to the point that i want save it for special occasions rather t
i was pleasantly surprised how this dress fit me very comfortable and flattering on me love the look need to watch not to wear anything scratchy as it may pull the fabric
this dress is really beautiful the material is soft and sways but it is sweaterlike not flimsy it does seem to run maybe a little large throughout but i liked that look not formfitting has more of a drape
i love this dress based on reviews i ordered the small and the only problem i had was that while the dress is quite large the detachable slip lining was quite tight and fitted which i didnt find comfortable so i replaced it with a flowy silk slip of my own and the results are great the fiber content contains a bit of wool but i do not find it scratchy to my skin and i am lovin the hilo aspects of the hem fun dress for winter
love this dress so cute and comfortable good for all seasons has a very nice under slip only issue is that it will snag very easily great color and i get lots of compliments
i knew i needed to have this shirt as soon as i saw it and luckily for me it was already on sale i read the other reviews and ordered a s usually order xs or s but went with s for this one because i was worried about the fit of the bust overall the shirt is huge on me i considered returning for an xs but suspect that would also be too big and maybe too short i decided i could get it tailored instead for the cost of exchange shipping so i will be doing that otherwise i love everything a
i needed to write a review only because i feel like the dress is getting a bad rap by other reviewers it is a loose flowy swing dress i typically wear structured fit and flare dresses but i do love a feminine loose casual dress from time to time too this totally fit the bill it is true to size fitted on the arms loose and swingy everywhere else i got the peach color and love it the cotton slip underneath is very comfortable too i ordered the sp and it hits just above my knees in th
i wore this dress for the first time the other day and it fit larger than i expected it is definitely not form fitting however i still love it just note the previous description if that is the sort of fit you were looking for as far as the length goes i am and the dress covers my knees
the quality and material of this dress is very nice its true to size and very pretty
this is a great addition its comfortable pretty and can be dressed up and down most importantly its slenderizing and a great length for me i bought it in my regular size but bought the petite size noting the model is and where the dress stopped on her im the dress fits perfectly and is a great length for me it also comes with a lovely blue slip such great quality for the price
love this dress ive already worn it many times i started off with a small but had to go to xs which is smaller than my normal size in order to get the fit as pictured the length is great and works with tights or boots great unique dress
another reviewer mentioned this was maternityish i am currently almost months pregnant and i have to say this is a wonderful maternity dress even if thats not what it was made for when not pregnant i think this might have been a little overwhelming and i guess well see next year if thats the case for me there is a lot of fabric here i am usually a small or medium in antrho dresses and i am wearing a small in this now with room to grow as my stomach grows the colors on the blu
i love the style of this jumpsuit it is so much more interesting than a long dress i am and need a few inches hemmed which will cut off some of the pretty embroidery at the bottom my biggest regret with this is that it is not made from better fabric it is a little stiff and scratchy if it were more silky it would be a dream but i am happy to have this in my closet i purchased this in the berry red
originally i bought this in black and white recently purchased several more in different colorways why its just perfect to wear as an under tankcami im a busty gal and sometimes cami straps can be too thin and dig into my shoulders this is soft smooth and provides just enough coverage very flattering fit on its own as well great under loose knit or low cut sweaters love
love this tank material and fit are great love that its reversible highly recommend
i had my eye on this piece since it came out but thought it was a little pricier than i like spending but it finally went on sale alas all the petite sizes are gone but i decided to order the regular xs anyway the length quote is long but i figured maybe with heels then the xxs became available and i snatched that tooso glad the xxs fits better and isnt as long i have to wear heels dont get me wrong but the xs was still long with heels it is soft and lovely the xxs linin
i hardly believe i have not reviewed htis yet so i tried it on in the sotre and was not convinced my usual xs looked huge and hte hip part flared out in a funny way i did however decide to order it online in petties to see i really do love the design in the front and the hemline is fun and unusual they didnt have my usual xs so odrdered xxs just to see what a great choice it fits like a glove now and the swaeter is jsut so beautiful jsut wish it wasnt so pricey but wil ke
i am an retailer employee i love this romper and suggested it to several of my regular ladies the day it arrived in our store they both loved the piece before they tried it onthe jumpsuit is so cute and has the special flair of a piece you would expect to find at retailer the piece is lined which is an added bonus but there is where the issue with the jumpsuit arrives the lining is to short makes it feel awkward i ordered the xxs petite and it fits perfect except the inside l
i have the raspberry jumper and i feel like royalty in it the silk is luxurious and looks expensive when i walk if feels like it is fluttering around me like butterflies around sleeping beauty typically i am quite disappointed when trying a jumper and find that what looked amazing on the model simply makes me look goofy but this one is the exception i think the super long length although problematic as well as the soft elegant drape of he fabric as well as the angled cut at the bodice ar
purchased it in raspberry first time it came in the mail it was stained and the hem looked like it had been dragged through the mud come on customer service you need to be more diligent about checking out items before you ship them i ordered it again and this time it was a new jumpsuit in plastic so pristine i am a size and the small fit me fine the lining is a little tight in the crotch area but i can put up with it for the style of this jumpsuit
the reason i gave this an overall rating of stars is because of the sizing the jumpsuit runs big and the black does not have a petite option otherwise i would give this stars this jumpsuit is so gorgeous that i had to buy both colors i bought the black in medium and it looks absolutely beautiful on but i will have to take it to get it altered it is way too big on me i really need a petite in this but i still bought the black and am getting it altered i loved this jumpsuit so much
just purchased these online and couldnt wait to try them on they are soft comfortable and my new favorite pair of jeans i love them i am and sz the color and quality are above my expectations 
beautiful dusty rose color the fit is fabulous love the sleeve and hem length very flattering and does not cling
love love this i was hesitant to buy this at first the reviews made it seem so big and i wasnt sure if it was my kind of outfit but i wanted to try a jumpsuit and this was the perfect find the xs was a typical retailer size for me so the size was good in this too the color is fabulous and the fit is great the rise is slightly short but not a problem i cant wait to where it for my next great event i wish i could buy it in the black too
this tank is soft and flexible great fit with wonderful material very pleased
i am in love with this piece i am long waisted and large busted so finding a jumpsuit to fit me can be challenging having said that i sized up when ordering this wrong ladiesno needi had to reorder my normal size and even that was roomy but in a good way as i prefer belting it with my huge concho belts i purchased it in the rasberry and i am still scratching my head as to why the black sold first the red is stunning and i find it more versatile going from casual to dressy and this
i just bought this dress and love the fit im pear shaped and its very flattering its not clingy because it is lined and it has great drape its also seasonless it will look great with boots and a sweater or kimono
i ordered this top because it was on a crazy sale and im really glad i did its super soft and comfortable but still very cute so its versatile you can wear it down or dress it up with a great skirt or jacket
my new favorite dress very flattering beautiful color and great length fabric feels very good as well im usually sm purchased the medium and it fits perfectly
this jumper is gorgeous i usually dont instantly spend almost on one piece without contemplating but as soon as i tried this on i fell in love i had to order it online because i needed the xsp as the xs in store was way too big please be warned that this runs large and definitely buy the petite if you are petite or a little taller i am for reference and even at its barely short enough to not be too long on me so if you are an inch or two taller i would recommend the pe
this is an awesome piece and i got many complements while wearing it it is that rare combo of super comfortable yet amazing look all in one it does run a bit big especially on top but the stride is short so i had to keep my regular size or i would have had a wedgie all night
such a gorgeous weight cut and style the button detail is adorable and the fit of the sweater is fantastic the hem style not sure what you would call it is incredibly flattering for an hourglass figure i am and dd fit is tts maybe a bit large but nothing crazy love
i recently wore this to a beach wedding and it worked out great with a cute denim jacket the orange color is pretty and vibrant and it is comfortable to wear i like the length of it and it flows really well as you walk the cons are that it wrinkles really easily i used a steamer extensively when it arrived to steam out the wrinkles but it still had a wrinkled look to it because i think of how the seams are as i got back up from sitting down for minutes the front and back were alr
this tunic is a nice basic to have it is like a light sweater knit the arm holes are a little large and hang low but can easily be remedied by wearing a camisole underneath nice with leggings or skinny jeans
the colors are beautiful on this shirt and it is true to size it is very comfortable but i wish the flowing part on top was pinned under arms or something it is attached at the top of the tank top but nowhere else so it just kind of lays over the tank with a poncho looki also think the top layer would look better if it was longer it hits at my natural waist and im petite i still plan on keeping it and think it will be cute enough with jeans just really wanted to love it
the fabric is super soft and the quality is just exceptional the patterncoloring is even more beautiful in person overall an excellent pair of leggings to work out in or run errands in
i just got these leggings yesterday and honestly theyre amazing they look just like the picture feel great on dont slip in the waist zero negatives i cant wait to wear these bad boys out
a little long but very comfortable ive worn it to work and to a bridal shower so very versatile
received this jacket yesterdayand it is lovely very well made with a relaxed yet feminine fit the cobalt blue accents are not as vivid as they appear online was slightly disappointed with that but being more subtle will make it more wearableso no oh she is wearing that jacket again the forest green is rich and elegant the fit is true to size but this is not a fitted jacket it falls more straight but the peplum is a gorgeous accent a classic with impeccable quality
i purchased a large and it fit perfect im a size dd the material is very forgiving and flows over my curves thick enough that it doesnt need a slip and will stretch to fit size ladies maybe size too im and the length is great on me with flat sandals doesnt show my bra either
i love the beading at the neck of this top and also the halflength banded sleeves it is a dressy top that is nevertheless very comfortable to wear it looks like silk although it is synthetic i do wish it came in a petite length because it is a bit long for me but it is one of those pieces you can just put on over a variety of pants or skirts and youre done and ready for work or going out to an event it requires little in the way of accessories because the beading at the neck acts as built
love this fun print one of the most complimented items in my closet i ordered petite after trying on the regular regular was a bit too long for the look in the models photo i am size usually the blue has faded a little bit the pants have maintained their fun and funky vibe
perhaps i purchased the wrong size i will return to a store and try on the small the medium just looks a little sloppy on me i absolutely love the length and the color will likely exchange for a smaller size and wear it all spring and summer
i absolutely love these jeans the rise is mid so it is perfect not too low and not too high the embroidered flowers are gorgeous and so unique these pants scream retailerpolgie to me i had to buy them as soon as i saw them because i know they will go fast pilcro denim fits great i ordered these online as my store didnt have them i ordered my normal size and they fit great i have an athletic build and they fit me like a glove with comfy room i cant wait till the temperature gets
i was looking for a top to wear out that was chic but not too dressy this top fit the bill the sleeves and the embellishments give it a very feminine touch i paired it with skinny black ankle pants and black heels and received lots of compliments it is comfortable and easy to wear for a long night out it does run big so i recommend sizing down also the sides are slightly sheer but i wore a black tank underneath without a problem great top
this bra is incredibly comfortable but not meant for practices that involve a lot of movement ie vinyasa but is perfect for lounging and personal practice the orange is a beautiful color
love love love these leggings a soft colorful comfortable way to show your artistic flare
pilcro denim with embellishment like this always wins me over these pair of jeans fit well the detail is so pretty for fall cant wait until it cools off to wear these the price point is a little high considering the silly shipping costs too love the jeans though
i know the photos for this dress show it as a very casual dress but i find it very eleganti really love this dress it is very simple but that is what makes it stunning the fabric is heavy enough to drape perfectly it fits really nice on top my bra fits just fine underneath and doesnt show im a short gal and i will have to wear a small heel even though i purchased an xxs petite im fine with that nice quality fits well done deal for me
im in love with these leggings they are super soft and comfortable they look cute on and are great for working out or even running errands very stylish too
love this dress havent worn it yet but wow the design artwork of the fabric is beautiful waiting for weather to cool off a bit so can wear with my off white suede gogo boots 
love this top i typically wear a and went with the on this one the length was better and the the buttons were perfectly closed i am a d this top looks great with everything
i found this tee to run true to size with a comfortable relaxed fit the neckline and elegant button gives this tee enough detail to dress it up if you wanted to take it in that direction
i love this dress i ordered the small i am and ibs the dress fell right at my knee cap i had it altered in length and now it looks great i was a little concerned about having to cut off some of the print design elements but it didnt effect the look 
im size top and the xl is a little big but it is a longer tshirt whihc i love thank you sooo much please return the size large back
it is a beautiful dressbut didnt fit methis is better for someone tall and thin
now i ordered both striped versions and i dont know which to keep the material is a nice soft knit the neck line is almost boatneck with little buttons so cute colors are really nice too i tried it on with skinnies and trousersa nd ti looked great with both i went with the petite version for those shorter gals out there xxs petite fit me i havnet tried o the xs petite yet and lbs i think it would loke nice with a pencil skirt too if i only had one that went wit
this is a nice sleeveless button down the bee design is really fun but the colors make this more stylish than i would have thought i tried it on with a pair of white shorts with a half tuck and it looked great i can also see it paired with trousers or flared jeans nice addition i purchased the or xs my usual size in regular length and it was fine the stylist also showed me how to tied it in the front to wear with high waisted pants i am lbs for reference and dd
nice quality can work as a jacket or sweater ive worn with and without the tie i didnt realize from the pictures but the sleeves bell out giving it an extra touch
i purchased the navy breton stripe version of this shirt its chic versatile and soft a great rendition of a wardrobe classic
loved the fabric of this dress and the slip that comes with it i wish the waist line fit a little better though i am with an athletic build and it looked really boxy on me i was so disappointed thought i could synch it in to make it work but think this is a return
love i wish this came in additional motifs hits at hip i have a long torso perfect for high rise skinny jeans and sandals
i bought this mainly because i have a similar one in the mustard colorway and i love how this flows the color is definitely one you dont see a lot of which is what makes it special i could see it running a tad large but i think its pretty true to size now im debating about buying it in blush
i am and lbs and could have worn the or but took the it does run short and the length in the was better than the with arm hole size being the same the bees are embroidered making the fabric high quality and normally i would run from a print like this but not this one it has great style
i really love this dress i cannot believe how many people have complimented me on this dress and ask where i bought it the color is so soft and pretty the dress is comfortable as well it looks great with a light pair of wedges
i bought this shirt in the tealnavy and loved it so much that i went back and bought the whitenavy too it is so soft the shirt runs a little tight but is stretchy and not uncomfortable the sleeve length and neckline dress up this shirt a little bit from being a standard t shirt yet it is just as comfortable overall very cute and flattering
love the colors in this autumn designed sweater that i just received but it has to be returned i disagree with one of the reviews that it is not as pictured as far as the green being off i think it is just as pictured i love the texture of the large pockets and belt with the suede feel i love the flap on the back what i dont like is how large it is i have never worn an xs from retailer and i should have listened to the advice from the previous reviews but i didnt i could send it back
i love the raw edges on this tshirt and the marled pink is a pretty color the fit is not as oversized as you might expect from the photos order your usual size its very soft and lightweight
i tried the redsalmon color on at the store its a very bright color but a nice one the top is formfitting with soft stretchy material there are two small buttons at each shoulder the sleeves are a good length the boatneck shows a little bit of bra strap but not too noticeable the only thing i didnt care for was the somewhat synthetic look of the material if youre between sizes size up as its a snug fit
fun versatile top for casual wear with capris denim or shortsskirts purchased both striped versions love ballet necklines the length sleeve is wonderful for spring summer fall in california the top is fitted yet it runs small be sure to sized up i normally wear xs however this was way too tight so ive ordered a small in both hoping it works perfectly
i ordered a size up after reading the reviews but i wouldnt of had to its not a snug fit at all although i am fairly small busted soft fabric with a little stretch that will be great for lounging around the house or running errands

i bought this dress on super sale online after seeing it in the store the pattern is just so beautiful and unique i think it looks much pretty in person than online there isnt a lot of shape to the dress but i like the loose style and can see this being worn with bootsbooties it also looks nice with a belt my only complaint is i had to size down to a usually an in dresses and the liner slip was a little tight also would have loved to try this in petite the regular falls to just
this blouse is very cute and will be great for summer casual wear so cute in this print it looks great with colored crop pants it is a bit tough to get the right fit in this top depending on your preference i usually wear a size in tops waist bc but went with a in this because it just felt wide otherwise also i am fine with it but this blouse seems to be somewhat short in the torso if you are particular possibly buy in store because the pattern of bees varies quite
beautiful cardigan but it does run large im about lbs normally a large in tops and the medium fits great its still a bit roomy but i think this cardigan is meant to be a tad roomy i agree with another reviewer that its a bit itchy on bare skin but its wool so thats a given overall a great cardigan for fall
love the fabric of this buttondown runs really large however am usually a small or xs so bought a its ok but is incredibly boxy and stands away from the body not in a good way i think it probably works well tied at the waist but alas i am too old to be showing off that part of my anatomy returned reluctantly hope others will enjoy
its the perfect long loose tshirt flattering without being fitted love it
this is such a cute top i bought it when it was a new arrival and couldnt be more thrilled it washes well in the the washing machine the only flaw is that it runs on the short side otherwise im thrilled
i purchased the cedar one not sure where they got color name from since i dont see any cedar in it the picture of the model is accurate in coloring and fit tts the sleeves are a little wider and longer at bottom but in a good way to me the pockets and belt are a suedelike material which makes for a lovely detail its not a slenderizing piece but not a frumpy fit imo at all soft material and nicely made but for that price i would hope so
im and a tad busty and this sweater i found to be most flattering i saw it i the store on was drawn to it i love the shimmer but perhaps thats because the holiday feel is already in the air in nyc the m fit great in both length pans width it looked great with my straight black jeans and boots i felt it made me look thin thankful i bought it on a discount day its a fabulous sweater

this sweater was instore in a more neutral color palette and was so pretty when i tried it on i noticed a few things the versatility and quality are definitely there this is a nice piece even at fullprice the downside is that it runs very large im typically a and a size xl in most retailer items and even the large was a bit roomy the other thing was that the sleeves of this sweater are pretty long and i have long arms due to the bell cut of the sleeve you couldnt even really c

this dress brought out my tamed inner kittytheres a collar so of course its tamed im in love with this unique print that roars retailer to all who admire this is not a hot weather dress because of long sleeves and fabric dropped stars cuz its yucky polyrayon and you need to size down or youll be drowning in fabric this cat doesnt swim looks great belted or underneath my black wool sweater im c and i purchased size

upon entering a local retailer store i saw this top almost instantly and decided to try it on fyi c broad shouldersback high waist almost and i normally wear a in a fitted buttonup shirt i can go down to a in a loosefit one but with the buttons i wouldnt expect this to be loosefitting i wear a m or l in a knit top i tried this on in but it was too big in the armholes and chest causing the top to stand out too much from my body when i tried on the these
i received this dress today and can not be happier im lbs c and the fits perfectly hitting about above my knees the print is so pretty and elegant the colors arent too vibrant arent too muted the collar and french cuffs give the dress an extra flair it comes with a little slip because the dress is sheer i just tried it on with suede booties and it looks adorable im ready for cooler temps to arrive so i can wear it
got the blue white striped in xs fits perfectly the arms are a little snug but it stretched to a comfortable fit its very comfy and good quality fabric
so much prettier in person than online the animal print isnt in your face but subtle enough for almost any occasion the buttonup collar and slightly past knee length make it work for a casual work environment the pleats and airiness of the dress remind me of kate middleton in anita dongre fit pounds i bought a six but the four would probably work as well because of the lightness of the fabric the extra fabric doesnt overwhelm my small frame goes slightly past my knee
this dress is so much prettier in person it will be great both for work and play cant wait to pair with booties into fall

i am busty and have a difficult time wearing stripes because they are not that flattering the stripes on this top are narrow and the material is thin which makes this great to wear under a jacket if you want to dress it up i am feet tall and ordered both the regular small and the ps because i wasnt sure which sleeves would be best on me as far as the length goes if you want the sleeves to look like they do on the model order the petite if thats what you usually order you can also get
what a great sweater the pale pink is sweet but the grey was more my style im c and the xs is perfect i know everyone is saying this sweater runs large but i believe this style is meant to be a bit oversized so i would call it true to size with that in mind the arms are long the shape is boxy but not short and i love the way it hangs on my thin frame its super soft cozy will easily be a goto sweater this fall

i wanted this top since the first time i saw it it fits perfectly in a small as i usually wear a small or medium it would probably fit better if you are smaller on top i am a a as it is not generously sized it flares at the bottom which looks quite flattering the lace on the sleeves really adds a lot of style i will wash it carefully as i am not sure how well the lace will hold up with washing this is a beautiful top and i am considering buying another in a different color i think

ive been searching high and low for a pair of flattering and comfortable linen pants im very particular and have turned down every pair until these these are perfect they fit true to size they are a relaxed but not baggy cut i hate saggy butt pants the legs are slightly tapered so they dont widen my frame they look great rolled up or left down the linen is soft not scratchy the elastic band sits comfortably on my waist they are also not see through a must for me i ordered th
yay hei hei love these pants thanks to the rollup they show a nice bit of ankle lightweight but sturdyive been reaching for them when it just seems too hot for jeans theyre a little poufy toward the top below the waist but the tie waist makes them sufficiently cinchable i expect to get a lot of wear out of these this summer i did experience some stretchingsagging after a full day of walking moving and sitting so i bought my second pair in m instead of l got navy and went back

this is simply a fabulous dress i think the issue with the other reviewers is that they are too small though there is nothing wrong with that i am not i am older and heavier and the dress fits very well im also rounder on the bottom so it is not baggy or tentlike the material and texture of the yarn is soft and comfortable you can wear it all day at the office and into the evening it looks great with a jean jacket for example and booties and it also looks terrific with flats it d

i bought this sweater in the black it is so flattering and feels great on the sleeves are a bit long but they are supposed to be the material is not overly thick yet it feels soft and well made while the lace sleeves are the star of this show the back is so flattering it has a perfect cut that i dont think comes through in the picture it fits true to size love this one
